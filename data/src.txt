[DWIGHT] Of course. Absolutely not. Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so... You could assume everyone is, and not say anything offensive.
[DWIGHT] I really don't think so.
[DWIGHT] Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
[DWIGHT] Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online. Yeah probably. He didn't tell the truth a lot.

[OSCAR] Am I the first gay man you ever knew?
[ANGELA] Judges and juries!
[DWIGHT] I think all the other office gays should identify themselves, or I will do it for them. [OSCAR] No one else in this office is gay. [DWIGHT] What about Phyllis? She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine! [PHYLLIS] I'm getting married to Bob Vance.

[PAM] You waited for me?
[PAM] You waited for me? [DWIGHT] I got it. When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins. When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus. Do I regret this? No. I believe his tissue has made me stronger. I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby.

Um, anyway, she was injured in a fight, and she was paralyzed. So, you can imagine how upset I was when I found out that she asked her manager to remove her breathing tube so she could die.

[PAM] I'd also like to say a few words if that's okay. What do we know about this bird? You might think, "Not much. It's just a bird." But we do know some things. We know it was a local bird. Maybe it's that same bird that surprised Oscar that one morning with a special present from above. [KEVIN] Oh, I remember that. That was SO funny. [PAM] And we know how he died. Flying into the glass doors. But you know what? I don't think he was being stupid. I think he just really, really wanted to come inside our building to spread his cheer and lift our spirits with a song. [DWIGHT] He's not a songbird.

[RYAN] Is there a prize? [PHYLLIS] Then how is this "Amazing Race"? [DWIGHT] Come on!! [PHYLLIS] Michael.
[ANDY] What's the deal with Dwight doing your laundry?
[ANDY] I think you have assembled an amazing team at Scranton. It's really a pleasure to be a part of it. It's like, everyone has their own special skill, you know, just like the Superfriends. Except for Dwight, who is more like a SuperDud. I mean, he would be a Superfriend if there was a Superfriend whose super power was always being late. You know?
[ANDY] My plan is taking longer than I thought but I don't give up easily. I have walked two marathons.
[BUYER] Yep.
[BUYER] Yep. [ANDY] Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once.
[BUYER] Yep. [ANDY] Caught an eighty-pound shark off of Montauk. It's in the Hamptons. My dad's got a 42-ft Bayliner. Sniped it with a rifle from the crow's nest. Also shot a deer once. Ok, this is the classic undersell because you should know we don't work out of a log cabin. We trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Ever heard of it? It's in New York. [BUYER] Uh, I have to say I am a little wary with getting involved with a big company. We've had some problems in the past.

I swear, this guy could sell paper to a tree.
[ANDY] Oh man. Talk about your classic "Lame dash O." Do we even want that guy buying our paper?
[ANDY] I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up.
[ANDY] I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up. I really 'Schruted' it.
[ANDY] I... I'm so sorry man. I really screwed that up. I really 'Schruted' it. 'Schruted' it. It's just this thing that people say around your office all the time. Like, when you screw something up in a really irreversible way, you 'Schruted' it. I don't know where it comes from though. Do you think it comes from Dwight Schrute?
[ANDY] Hey boss. Got a minute?
[ANDY] Hey boss. Got a minute? I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning?
[ANDY] Hey boss. Got a minute? I forget, why did Dwight say he was late this morning? That's weird. Because I was just walking past his desk and I saw this, which is a tollbooth receipt from New York City, stamped really early this morning. So, why would Dwight go to New York without telling anyone? Do you think he went to see Jan? That's not like him. Is it? Someone told me a story about this, with, like, laundry and betrayal. Did you betray Dwight and try to steal his job or something?
[JAN] Dwight's name is on the security sign-in sheet, but I don't know who he met with. And where it asks to state your business, he wrote "Beeswax. Not yours, Inc."
[DWIGHT] Hey, we nailed the sale!

And I miss you. You were my best friend before you went to Stamford, and I really miss you. I shouldn't have been with Roy. And there were a lot of reasons to call off my wedding. But the truth is, I didn't care about any of those reasons until I met you. And now you're with someone else. And that's... fine. It's... whatever. That's not what... I'm not... Okay, my feet really hurt. The thing that I'm just trying to say to you, Jim... and to everyone else in this circle I guess, is that I miss having fun with you. Just you, not everyone in the circle. Okay, I am going to go walk in the water now. Yeah. It's a good day.

Council: "Was he seriously being considered for the corporate job?" David Wallace: "No." [LESTER] I have one more question, Mr. Scott. Wouldn't you agree with Ms. Levinson that the company exhibits a pattern of disrespect toward its employees?
[DAVID] Michael. I am very sorry.

[HOLLY] Thanks Michael.  Today we're going to have a business ethics seminar because recently, without mentioning any names, there has been some misconduct at corporate and we have a very strict ethics policy and that employee has been fired. [KEVIN] Oh come on! He's right there.  He was hired.  Oh check it out, "Hired Guy." [JIM] Nice. [RYAN] Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six?  Anyone know Joanna on that show?  In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So...
[RYAN] Ok, elephant in the room. Let's talk about it. Do I regret what I did? Of course I do. Even though it was an amazing ride, and I'll give you an example. Anyone see Survivor season six?  Anyone know Joanna on that show?  In New York City, I hooked up with a girl who looked exactly like that. Indistinguishable. So... [HOLLY] Let's start discussing those questionnaires that you filled in this morning. It is wrong to make personal calls during work hours. Now, some of you marked that you very strongly agree. But ideally you would have selected totally agree. [PHYLLIS] I thought very strongly agree sounded stronger than totally agree. [HOLLY] Corporate would like to emphasize that ideally you would all totally agree with that statement.
[HOLLY] Yes, it's called time theft, and it's the same as taking money from the company. Can anyone think of examples of things that are over the line time wasters? [STANLEY] This meeting. [ANDY] Hey-oh! [DWIGHT] Yes.
[DWIGHT] Yes. [KELLY] Why is ok for smokers to take breaks all the time? If I want to go outside and hang out once an hour, then I'll just take up smoking. I'll do it. I don't care. [MEREDITH] I'll smoke with you. I got a bag of cigars in my purse. [HOLLY] Stealing office supplies is another big ethical area that there seems to be some confusion about.

[DWIGHT] What should we be working on while you guys are talking? [HOLLY] Well, I just have to get through the binder. I am? [MICHEAL] Yeah, don't think about the stakes. It'll freak you out. [HOLLY] Ok.  Michael makes a really good point so, uh, let's just open this up a little bit. Say my name is Lauren and here I am shopping in a supermarket and I steal a pencil. That's not right.
[ANDY] I'll drop an ethics bomb on you. Would you steal bread to feed your family? ... Boom! [OSCAR] Exactly, Andy. [DWIGHT] It's a trick question. The bread is poisoned. Also, it's not your real family. You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male. [ANDY] No that's... not how it works.

We were thinking of having two branch managers in Scranton. Both of you guys working as co-managers. Jim would handle the day to day and Michael you would focus on clients and big picture stuff. [JIM] Wow, that sounds pretty cool. [DAVID] Co-manager and Co-manager. See, there are a lot of moving pieces and this is the only way I can sell it upstairs.

[PAM] Like... a year. [JIM] I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So... I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses-- [MEMA] What's obvious? Why can't Pam drink? [JIM] Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.

[GROTTI] As a manager of business, you have a lot of pride. But you also got a lot of responsibility None greater perhaps, than your need to be sure, that your small or large business is secure in the event of a covered loss.
[ANDY] What do you think? [DWIGHT] I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags. [GROTTI] God forbid you... should have a fire in the warehouse.
[ANDY] What do you think? [DWIGHT] I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags. [GROTTI] God forbid you... should have a fire in the warehouse. Yeah, and a truck, goes off the side of the road, there's injury.

[ANDY] What happened in there?
[ANDY] What happened in there? [DWIGHT] Did he threaten you?
[ANDY] What happened in there? [DWIGHT] Did he threaten you? [ANDY] Mobsters are!
[ANDY] Mobsters are! He drives an SUV! [DWIGHT] I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space. [OSCAR] Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob? [DWIGHT] No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
[OSCAR] Hey guys, I drive a SUV, does that mean I'm in the mob? [DWIGHT] No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster. [ANDY] All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation. [OSCAR] For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia.
[ANDY] All mobsters have a front, sometimes it's selling insurance, sometimes it's waste management or sanitation. [OSCAR] For the record, not all Italian-Americans are in the Mafia. [ANDY] Yeah, buy my insurance or I'll burn your warehouse down! [DWIGHT] Exactly.
[RYAN] Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.'
[RYAN] Well first of all, there is no such thing as 'The Mafia.' What you have are specific families. What's the guy's last name?
[PHYLLIS] So he won't get caught! [ANDY] Yeah. It's pretty close. [OSCAR] No, what are you talking about, what mobster would change his name from Gotti to Grotti. It weakens it. [DWIGHT] No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it "murder." And not "muck-duck."

[ANDY] That's how it works! When somebody threatens you, you give in right away. Okay you need to buy insurance from this guy and get him off your back [DWIGHT] No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat. [ANDY] Dwight... [DWIGHT] The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him. Trust me, I have bullied a lot of people.
[DWIGHT] Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent. [ANDY] Okay. [DWIGHT] Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous. [ANDY] I like this plan. I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.

[ANDY] Well if I'm gonna back you up, I need a weapon without drawing suspicion, and I have to justify it somehow so, I'm a mechanic with a tire thing. [DWIGHT] Do you know how to use it? [ANDY] To change tires, no. But it's metal, I can hit somebody with it.

[JIM] Hey.
[JIM] Hey. Well, the grass is always greener.
[JIM] Hey. Well, the grass is always greener. Well, it's what you wanted.
[JIM] Hey. Well, the grass is always greener. Well, it's what you wanted. For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
[JIM] Hey. Well, the grass is always greener. Well, it's what you wanted. For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do. Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
[JO] You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management?
[JO] You two are grown-ass men. What do I have to do, fire you and get two people in here who don't need so much management? [JIM] Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.

I don't care which one of you does which job, just stop meeting with me to talk about it. [JIM] Alright.
[ERIN] Sure does! Okay, we have your space heater, your humidifier, your dehumidifier, your fan, your foot fan, and your food dehydrator.
[PAM] Ooh.
[PAM] Ooh. [JIM] Michael.
[PAM] Ooh. [JIM] Michael. Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
[PAM] Ooh. [JIM] Michael. Michael, you shouldn't have done that. [PAM] You know the baby's not going to live here, right?
[PAM] Ooh. [JIM] Michael. Michael, you shouldn't have done that. [PAM] You know the baby's not going to live here, right? [JIM] Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here. Burning man, port-o-potty.
[ERIN] Ooh, spooky. But why? [JIM] Because the insurance company only covers two nights. [PAM] Everything's fine. We have plenty of time. [NICK] Well, you don't want to wait too long, Pam. Otherwise the baby's going to become a teenager in there and you'll be up all night, from the rock music.
[ANDY] Guys. Word of advice. Speaking as a former baby. Don't get too hung up on baby names. I was named Walter Jr. after my father until I was about six or so, when my parents changed their minds. [ERIN] I thought you said your younger brother was named Walter Jr. [ANDY] My brother was born, and my parents felt he better exemplified the Walter Jr. name, so they gave it to him. I was given Andrew, which they got out of a baby name book. [JIM] You know, it's getting real crowded in here. Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.

Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals. [PAM] Actually, the distractions are good. I mean, I don't think I'm going to make it until midnight if I'm just sitting here thinking about it.
[ANDY] Can we do sleight of hand tricks?
[ANDY] Can we do sleight of hand tricks? Yes! Can anyone do those? [STANLEY] I'm going to go look at the Internet. [JIM] Oh! Oh, alright. That's a good one. [PAM] Oh, okay, uh, sorry, guys. Just, um, keep talking.

[ERIN] Um, stimulate the nipples. [KEVIN] Her shirt is touching them. Maybe we should cut holes in her shirt. [MEREDITH] I have a shirt like that in my car. [ERIN] Okay, uh, the second one is walk around. We're already doing the opposite of that. Perfect. Okay, number three, eat spicy foods.

[KEVIN] Our ultra feast menu's theme: Hollywood. We have Ratatouille, from Ratatouille, and tandoori chicken, from Born Into Brothels. I tried to bake a cake like that District 9 prawn thing, but I... Are you okay? [PAM] Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm fine. Um, yeah, the doctor said it's still considered a minor contraction as long as I can talk through it.

[JO] Oh good morning sweetheart.
[JO] Oh good morning sweetheart. I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands?
[JO] Oh good morning sweetheart. I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands? Is that a lump of coal?
[JO] Oh good morning sweetheart. I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands? Is that a lump of coal? Have I been that naughty?
[JO] Oh good morning sweetheart. I'm sorry but is that a gift I see in your hands? Is that a lump of coal? Have I been that naughty? Err, thank you very much. We, we don't get to see much coal in Tallahassee, I'm used to alligators, and some of the worst Chinese food you've ever tasted.
[JO] Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like.
[JO] Now, after all the talking I've been doing. It's your turn. This is a town hall meeting. I want to hear what you all sound like. Thank you. You know I get way too many ideas from the top. Now I want to hear your ideas. I mean, did you guys know that Liquid Paper? That wasn't invented by some fancy engineer. No, that was created by a lowly typist. [KEVIN] Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap. [JO] You know it doesn't have to be an invention. [OSCAR] I have a question.
[KEVIN] Jo, I have an idea, for suntan lotion - soap. [JO] You know it doesn't have to be an invention. [OSCAR] I have a question. In the training manual it says, that there is a minority executive training program in Tallahassee? [JO] I am so proud of Sabre's "Print In All Colors" initiative. Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply.  Daryl?

Any Sabre employee of color, is welcome to apply.  Daryl? Okay hush now.
[DARYL] The Sabre shipping method could be more efficient. Combining inventory systems makes sense on paper, but printers and paper ship differently. It'll be faster to deliver them separately, instead of waiting on everything to come in. [JO] But you wouldn't need more trucks? [DARYL] Not at all. There's a way that it can be scheduled. I sketched this out downstairs. [JO] Oh look at you.

Florida ain't that far away. Well, anytime now. Oh honey you didn't buy a ticket? Oh honey. I'm not home, very often. And uh, me and my relatives, they take up the guesthouse. I think you should check with my office, before you book any dates, okay?

[JO] No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set.
[JO] No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set. Yes it is.
[JO] No, that's very generous of you, but I'm all set. Yes it is. How many knocks does it take to get you to do some work?
[DARYL] Not bad, huh?
[DARYL] Not bad, huh? I impressed her with my good ideas.
[DARYL] Not bad, huh? I impressed her with my good ideas. I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there.
[DARYL] Not bad, huh? I impressed her with my good ideas. I made a suggestion at the meeting that was good. You were there. Now Mike, I have to ask you to leave, so that I can learn about this tiny television.

[JO] Hey there. Well there's chatting time and there's working time. I'm still on working time. Well, if you feel like you've done a solid days work... Well I mean, if you can put your name on this day, and be proud of the amount of work you've done, then, by all means, you should toodle on home.

[ANDY] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day.
[ANDY] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day. [ERIN] I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch.
[ANDY] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day. [ERIN] I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch. [ANDY] Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. .
[ANDY] I was just wondering what you had planned for Secretary's Day. [ERIN] I know that Erin would be so psyched if you took her out to lunch. [ANDY] Yeah. She really looks up to you. And there's only so much we can do as her coworkers. Secretary's Day is really kind of a boss-secretary thing. . That's my girlfriend you're talking about.
[ERIN] Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss.
[ERIN] Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss. I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's.
[ERIN] Well, happy Boss's day. There wouldn't be a secretary if there was no boss. I got a picture of you asking me to lunch. I was thinking we could go to Hayworth's. Just the two of us.

[ERIN] I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager?
[ERIN] I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager? I would have chosen the 1490's.
[ERIN] I was thinking it would be fun to talk on the way over. So what decade would you have chosen to be a teenager? I would have chosen the 1490's. 'Cause America was discovered.
[ERIN] And then my last job was at a Taco Bell express. But then it became a full Taco Bell, and I don't know, I couldn't keep up. My favorite part about being a receptionist is that I get to have my own desk. In my Foster home I never had a desk. . So it's like... I don't mean that I didn't like my foster home. I did like it. I just didn't have a desk there. Did you have a favorite age? Or month?

I am saying the exact opposite. Angela is fantastic. Specific shout-out.. Ok. As some of you may know, I have a very special connection with Secretary's Day in the form of that 115 pound moonbeam over there named Erin Hannon. To a lot of you she may just be the person who brings you your fax comformations. But to me, she is my girlfriend... in addition to being the person who brings me my fax comformations. So I wrote  a little ditty. That I would like to play for all of you right now. It's a little tune called Secretary of Love. A one, a two, a one, two, three.. [ERIN] I know about Angela! I know that you were engaged to her and that you were sleeping with her! Michael told me.
[ANDY] Why would that be something to talk about on Secretary's Day?

[OSCAR] Your office is full of genitalia. "That's what he says?" [ANGELA] Angela.  Michael.
[JIM] All right, so I'll finish up on bulk pricing, and then you go into delivery guarantee. [PAM] You know, maybe there's an opportunity for a joke there, like, um... like,  "I just delivered a baby. They didn't offer me a guarantee." [JIM] Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that.

You know, she's touching around down there. It's easy to get confused. [ERIN] Michael, I think Donna left this here. Should I put it in the lost and found for 14 days and then I can take it home?

[ANDY] I just wanna go on record as saying that I do not condone this affair, and I went so far as to force Michael to confront the victim of his behavior. [PAM] Did you talk to him?

[RYAN] All right, that makes more sense. You should have said that at the beginning when you said, "I read a book about anthropology." [KELLY] I don't really know why you're screaming at me right now. [RYAN] I'm not scream-- I'm not screaming. [KELLY] That's Meredith's cake. It's her birthday.

[JO] Howdy. I hope I'm not interrupting anything.
[KEVIN] Jo, I think that I know what happened. [JO] I'm not sure you do, teddy bear. [KEVIN] Well, now I think I might not. [JO] Not long ago, we discovered a defect in one of our printers, so we got a software patch and fixed it right up, just like that. I don't know how it works. But just as we were about to send out a letter to our affected customers, giving 'em free toner, and we keep 'em, happy, but somebody here, they liked that first story better. The one where we lose half our clients for no damn good reason! Whoever it was who talked to the press, they should come forward, please.

[PAM] Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers?
[PAM] Wouldn't we get fired for smashing all the computers? [KELLY] That idea sucks. [PAM] I don't think that's a good idea.
[KELLY] That idea sucks. [PAM] I don't think that's a good idea. [DARRYL] Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat. [KELLY] Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl.
[PAM] I don't think that's a good idea. [DARRYL] Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat. [KELLY] Uh, if you turn me in, I'm turning in Darryl. [PAM] Nobody's going to prison, okay? Um... all right, Michael, you need to convince Jo to go easy on us. And then we'll all confess once we know our jobs are safe.
[JO] Michael.
[JO] Michael. Michael Scott... what do you know?
[JO] If it doesn't matter, then tell me.
[JO] If it doesn't matter, then tell me. Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it.
[JO] If it doesn't matter, then tell me. Because I want to deal with it the way I deal with it. Empathize with me for a moment. I came up here with a big problem, and now I got a branch manager who's giving me the silent treatment... Speak to me... speak.  Come with me.

[JO] When I was growing up, there was nothing better than being a big old business tycoon. And I thought I'd break that glass ceiling and be a hero to all those little girls out there... and they'd make a Barbie out of me. I, did I sell cheap printers? I do. But if I have to go out there in front of the press and make one of them public apology recalls, I mean, it's all I'll ever be remembered for. Nobody will want to play with my Barbie.

[JIM] Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, "I don't own an Ebay store," so...

[JO] Why is this my problem, Michael?
[JO] Why is this my problem, Michael? [GABE] Those overnight packages needed to go out, and Michael refuses to hold the guilty party accountable. [JO] Lower yourself, Gabe. I don't wanna be having a conversation with your crotch. Ok, educate me now why you won't fire the boy.

[MEREDITH] Wow, so this building can get uglier. [STANLEY] I will not work in a roach billboard. [GABE] Oh my God, I can't look at roaches. [ANGELA] Michael do something about this.
[JIM] Woah, there is a lot of brainpower in this room. We've got Michael and Oscar, the two smartest guys in the office, also in that order. [OSCAR] Funny Jim. That is funny.
[OSCAR] What is it? [KELLY] Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael? [OSCAR] Alright. Alright I get it. [KELLY] Michael, how do I create a new tab?
[KELLY] Can you move aside so that I can ask Michael? [OSCAR] Alright. Alright I get it. [KELLY] Michael, how do I create a new tab? [OSCAR] That's print.
[KEVIN] Then see you later building. [DWIGHT] You can't possibly be serious. [KEVIN] I said see you later building. [OSCAR] Hey Michael.
[KEVIN] Then see you later building. [DWIGHT] You can't possibly be serious. [KEVIN] I said see you later building. [OSCAR] Hey Michael. I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China.
[KEVIN] Then see you later building. [DWIGHT] You can't possibly be serious. [KEVIN] I said see you later building. [OSCAR] Hey Michael. I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China. I'd love to talk more about it.
[KEVIN] Then see you later building. [DWIGHT] You can't possibly be serious. [KEVIN] I said see you later building. [OSCAR] Hey Michael. I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China. I'd love to talk more about it. Maybe over some coffee later?
[DWIGHT] You can't possibly be serious. [KEVIN] I said see you later building. [OSCAR] Hey Michael. I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China. I'd love to talk more about it. Maybe over some coffee later? [JIM] Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
[OSCAR] Hey Michael. I was thinking about some of the stuff you said earlier about China. I'd love to talk more about it. Maybe over some coffee later? [JIM] Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to? No. [ANDY] It is not just coffee. [JIM] He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
[JIM] Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to? No. [ANDY] It is not just coffee. [JIM] He's trying to set you up Michael.

Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him? [ANDY] And then he will smugly pay the cheque and make you feel so small.

[RYAN] Where is Tibet?
[RYAN] Where is Tibet? When was China founded?
[RYAN] Where is Tibet? When was China founded? [JIM] Two for two, keep it up. [RYAN] Who is Mao?
[RYAN] Where is Tibet? When was China founded? [JIM] Two for two, keep it up. [RYAN] Who is Mao? [ANDY] Damn it. Michael, you are moments away from the smack down of your life. If you don't know something, steer the conversation back to something you do know.
[JIM] What do you know about boobs? [ANDY] Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II. [JIM] Thank you. [ANDY] This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you!
[JIM] What do you know about boobs? [ANDY] Michael, I have to tell you something it's from Rocky II. [JIM] Thank you. [ANDY] This guy doesn't just wanna win. Y'know, he want's to bury you. He wants to humiliate you! I'm like a quarter of the way through.

[OSCAR] Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated.
[OSCAR] Michael, the reason I asked you down here for this chat is that I've been thinking that your fears about China are a bit exaggerated. We have missiles too.
[OSCAR] Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan.
[OSCAR] Actually, we're in a mild recession right now. I'll give you that, but people use China as the boogie man for all their problems. In the nineteen eighties, it was Japan. Do you really think that manufacturing is a relevant indicator of where the world economy's heading in 2011? Do you know the comparative expansion of say the information sector? I'd say that's far more relevant. Wouldn't you?
[OSCAR] Don't worry about the coffee, its on me.
[OSCAR] Don't worry about the coffee, its on me. Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat.
[OSCAR] Don't worry about the coffee, its on me. Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat. What?

[OSCAR] Don't worry about the coffee, its on me. Michael, I am so happy that we were able to have this little chat. What? [ERIN] Fire him. No, show mercy. [OSCAR] What's your point.

[OSCAR] What's your point. [ANDY] Yeah. [ERIN] Right, yes. [OSCAR] That's not.

[JIM] One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go. [PAM] Okay, this is just a Christmas card from your paper supplier. No one's putting this on their fridge. [KEVIN] Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'. [ANDY] Let's just jump in the air!
[KEVIN] Oh, I got it, you guys, how 'bout this. Michael, what if all the boys are on one side, all the girls are on the other. The boys are like, 'why I oughta', and the girls are like, 'let's go shopping!'. [ANDY] Let's just jump in the air! [PAM] Okay. [NATE] One, two, three.  Not everyone jumped.
[NATE] Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'. [ERIN] I didn't want to miss it. [ANDY] Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. [OSCAR] Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it?
[NATE] Um, also, Erin is jumping way too early. She's on the ground by 'three'. [ERIN] I didn't want to miss it. [ANDY] Well, if we all jump really high, we'll be in the air longer. Do that. [OSCAR] Here's a question nobody's asking: Is this worth it? Why?

[PAM] Hey guys, the tree's here.
[PAM] Hey guys, the tree's here. [ANDY] Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so... [OSCAR] Why would someone hug you?
[PAM] Hey guys, the tree's here. [ANDY] Nobody hug me, I'm covered in tree sap, so... [OSCAR] Why would someone hug you? [DARRYL] Are you serious?
[OSCAR] Why would someone hug you? [DARRYL] Are you serious? [JADA] He doesn't look like Santa Claus. [DARRYL] No, he doesn't.  I told her Santa would be here.
[DARRYL] Are you serious? [JADA] He doesn't look like Santa Claus. [DARRYL] No, he doesn't.  I told her Santa would be here. [PAM] Who told you that?
[HOLLY] You guys, this has to stop. Someone could have really gotten hurt.
[DWIGHT] I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress. [JIM] What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. [DWIGHT] With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. [HOLLY] Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends.
[JIM] What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. [DWIGHT] With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. [HOLLY] Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends. [DWIGHT] Wait, what girlfriend?
[JIM] What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me. [DWIGHT] With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. [HOLLY] Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends. [DWIGHT] Wait, what girlfriend? I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
[DWIGHT] With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing. [HOLLY] Dwight's right. What you did was dangerous and inappropriate. I'm really surprised at you guys. Last time I was here, you were both best friends. [DWIGHT] Wait, what girlfriend? I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit. [HOLLY] I didn't know you had a girlfriend.
[HOLLY] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving. [PHYLLIS] Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. [ERIN] That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even.
[HOLLY] Who did this? It's obvious to me I'm not welcome here, but somebody better tell me who did this, or else I'm leaving. [PHYLLIS] Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. [ERIN] That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even. [TOBY] No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do.
[PHYLLIS] Well, I don't think Erin seems to like you. [ERIN] That's not true. I don't know her enough to make a decision even. [TOBY] No, I would never ever do anything like that. But it does seem like something you would do. [KEVIN] Wait, wait, guys, listen. Toy Story is all about toys that come to life when people aren't looking.

[GABE] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just... like it's coming from my own head.
[GABE] I hear them kissing all the time. It's this horrible plipping sound. You know, it's like Chinese water torture. Just... like it's coming from my own head. [HOLLY] Ohh. Can you get lower?
[GABE] Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice. Yes?
[GABE] Thank you all for meeting on such sort notice. Yes? Seeing as it's Valentine's Day, I felt it would be apropos to have a little refresher course on romance in the workplace.
[GABE] Butt honking. Yeah, all the honking. [CREED] The one where you start in a crouches position, then you leap... [GABE] Sure. Basically, there's no precise definition, but you know it when you see it. Ahem. [OSCAR] Are you guys listening to this?
[HOLLY] So we kiss occasionally. [OSCAR] Not occasionally. All the time. [PHYLLIS] Yeah, and it's not just the kissing. It's the flirtatious whispering. [STANLEY] The flirtatious tickling.

[OSCAR] Good. [ANGELA] No. [OSCAR] Just leave it how you said... [DWIGHT] Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation?
[OSCAR] Good. [ANGELA] No. [OSCAR] Just leave it how you said... [DWIGHT] Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation? Yes!

[HOLLY] Two people in love?
[HOLLY] Two people in love? Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean you love me? We've only been dating for a week. Do you mean you love me like, "oh, hey, there's Holly. I love that girl." Or you do you mean you love me like you love me-love me?

[GABE] You have to cut it out. [HOLLY] Okay.
[GABE] You have to cut it out. [HOLLY] Okay. You said you would.
[HOLLY] Okay. You said you would. [GABE] No one is a bigger fan of sexual touching than me. But with you two, it's reaching the level of a complex. I can think of three explanations. One: You're taking MDMA. Street name, ecstasy. I've done it, and I know the feeling. [HOLLY] No, I don't think so. [GABE] Number two: You're desperately trying to fit in a whole relationship before Toby comes back from jury duty and Holly has to go back to Nashua. Or three: You're at an age where your sexual climaxes aren't as powerful so you need to overcompensate with foreplay, taboo behavior.
[HOLLY] Give me all your money and take off your clothes.
[HOLLY] Give me all your money and take off your clothes. Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong?
[HOLLY] Give me all your money and take off your clothes. Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong? Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance.
[HOLLY] Give me all your money and take off your clothes. Come one. Nobody's looking. What's wrong? Maybe we didn't want to think about it. We can make it work. We'll date long-distance. We weren't in love last time.
