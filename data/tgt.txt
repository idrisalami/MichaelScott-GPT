[MICHAEL] So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
[MICHAEL] All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
[MICHAEL] If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.
[MICHAEL] Any messages?
[MICHAEL] Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
[MICHAEL] It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
[MICHAEL] Whassup!
[MICHAEL] Whass...up!
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] OK. All right. See you later.
[MICHAEL] Back to work.
[MICHAEL] Um... Me no get an agenda.
[MICHAEL] I didn't get any agenda.
[MICHAEL] Really? I didn't...  Did we get a fax this morning?
[MICHAEL] Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] OK...
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
[MICHAEL] All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
[MICHAEL] OK. No problem.
[MICHAEL] Me no wanna hear that, Jan. Because downsizing is a bitch. It is a real bitch. And I wouldn't wish that on Josh's men. I certainly wouldn't wish it on my men. Or women, present company excluded. Sorry. Uh, is Josh concerned about downsizing himself? Not downsizing himself but is he concerned about downsizing?
[MICHAEL] Oh, that's not appropriate.
[MICHAEL] Uh, I don't know what you mean.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
[MICHAEL] No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that.
[MICHAEL] Guilty! Guilty as charged!
[MICHAEL] Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
[MICHAEL] Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!  Ah, right here. Three Stooges. Oh, Pam. It's a guy thing, Pam. I'm sort of a student of comedy. Watch this. Here we go.  I'm Hitler. Adolf Hitler.
[MICHAEL] Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.
[MICHAEL] Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry?
[MICHAEL] If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.
[MICHAEL] Assistant to the Regional Manager.
[MICHAEL] I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
[MICHAEL] You don't know what it is.
[MICHAEL] I don't need your permission.
[MICHAEL] Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
[MICHAEL] Not gonna happen.
[MICHAEL] It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
[MICHAEL] I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
[MICHAEL] Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
[MICHAEL] No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.
[MICHAEL] Introduce yourself. Be polite.
[MICHAEL] Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
[MICHAEL] That's his profit.
[MICHAEL] OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
[MICHAEL] Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
[MICHAEL] And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
[MICHAEL] Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
[MICHAEL] Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
[MICHAEL] Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
[MICHAEL] You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
[MICHAEL] Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
[MICHAEL] Why? Well, theft and stealing.
[MICHAEL] Post-it Notes.
[MICHAEL] 50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know, you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I am.
[MICHAEL] But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] I don't know about that.
[MICHAEL] Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
[MICHAEL] Did you have a good weekend going there?
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
[MICHAEL] Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!
[MICHAEL] Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
[MICHAEL] It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
[MICHAEL] Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!
[MICHAEL] You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.
[MICHAEL] Exactly, were not...
[MICHAEL] With tolerance.
[MICHAEL] Ignorance.
[MICHAEL] Let's celebrate.
[MICHAEL] Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?
[MICHAEL] You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey why don't you run it by me and I'll run it by him.
[MICHAEL] OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...
[MICHAEL] Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.
[MICHAEL] I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.
[MICHAEL] OK, I will play guy listening.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me...  Every time... Every time black people want to have a good time, some ignant ass...  I take care of my kid!
[MICHAEL] They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!
[MICHAEL] What you want a cookie?
[MICHAEL] I don't think I can sign this.
[MICHAEL] Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?
[MICHAEL] Sure.
[MICHAEL] Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.
[MICHAEL] OK, well I know. You told me that several times.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.
[MICHAEL] I won't.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah.
[MICHAEL] "I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.
[MICHAEL] Get out.
[MICHAEL] No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
[MICHAEL] Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
[MICHAEL] Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
[MICHAEL] Two fifteenths.
[MICHAEL] Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah...
[MICHAEL] Wow.
[MICHAEL] Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
[MICHAEL] Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
[MICHAEL] Well, it has certain connotations.
[MICHAEL] Like... I don't... I don't know.
[MICHAEL] No. Now, remember that honesty...
[MICHAEL] ...empathy, respect...  Jim! Jim!
[MICHAEL] Push it.
[MICHAEL] Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
[MICHAEL] No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
[MICHAEL] Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
[MICHAEL] OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
[MICHAEL] Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi.  Try my googi, googi. Try my...
[MICHAEL] Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
[MICHAEL] Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
[MICHAEL] Lay them on me. What?
[MICHAEL] That's not what you said earlier.
[MICHAEL] I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
[MICHAEL] I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
[MICHAEL] Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
[MICHAEL] You gotta crack these things open.
[MICHAEL] Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
[MICHAEL] Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
[MICHAEL] There, there...
[MICHAEL] When have you ever done that?
[MICHAEL] Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
[MICHAEL] Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
[MICHAEL] You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
[MICHAEL] Nope, you cannot use it.
[MICHAEL] Temporary workspace. You can use it.
[MICHAEL] Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
[MICHAEL] Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
[MICHAEL] Pam! Whoa, whoa, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I, I, I, I gotta go. I'm getting a call.
[MICHAEL] I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
[MICHAEL] Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
[MICHAEL] Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
[MICHAEL] Ah, what? Which memo?
[MICHAEL] Is it a good plan?
[MICHAEL] Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
[MICHAEL] No, no , no, you know what? I said nothing specific because I was so busy. Why don't you go in there and find these people a plan that will work for them? OK?
[MICHAEL] OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
[MICHAEL] Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldn't find the knob.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
[MICHAEL] Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.
[MICHAEL] So it's not a free fall?
[MICHAEL] Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
[MICHAEL] Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
[MICHAEL] There you go.
[MICHAEL] Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Christ.
[MICHAEL] Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
[MICHAEL] Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
[MICHAEL] Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
[MICHAEL] Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
[MICHAEL] All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
[MICHAEL] Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
[MICHAEL] There's no downsizing.
[MICHAEL] Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
[MICHAEL] Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
[MICHAEL] Next person on the...
[MICHAEL] ...calendar.
[MICHAEL] Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
[MICHAEL] Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
[MICHAEL] She's not the only one that's going to be eating it, right? I think everybody likes ice-cream cake. It's not, uh, it's not just about her, so...
[MICHAEL] Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
[MICHAEL] Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...
[MICHAEL] Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
[MICHAEL] There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
[MICHAEL] I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
[MICHAEL] Which one is that again?
[MICHAEL] Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
[MICHAEL] You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
[MICHAEL] Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
[MICHAEL] It's surprise Meredith. One, two...
[MICHAEL] Find a key.
[MICHAEL] And many more!
[MICHAEL] You were surprised, weren't you?
[MICHAEL] You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" Good cake. Why don't you have some?
[MICHAEL] Come on. A little bit.
[MICHAEL] Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
[MICHAEL] You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.
[MICHAEL] Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.
[MICHAEL] Is Oscar around?
[MICHAEL] I know...
[MICHAEL] Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
[MICHAEL] How many miles did he do last year?
[MICHAEL] Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
[MICHAEL] Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
[MICHAEL] I don't know about that.
[MICHAEL] Huh! Thanks, downer.
[MICHAEL] Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
[MICHAEL] You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
[MICHAEL] Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..."
[MICHAEL] Everybody? If... could do it? "Meredith is so old..."
[MICHAEL] "She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."
[MICHAEL] This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers? I think we could have done better than that.
[MICHAEL] OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.
[MICHAEL] Per mile, yes.
[MICHAEL] Come here.  Don't cash that till Friday, OK?
[MICHAEL] No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
[MICHAEL] When I let him come to my pick-up game...
[MICHAEL] I vouched for you.
[MICHAEL] I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight. All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
[MICHAEL] Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
[MICHAEL] Yes it is. Assistant to the regional manager.
[MICHAEL] No, it's not. It's lower, so...
[MICHAEL] And here we have "Mister Roger's Neighborhood." Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.
[MICHAEL] And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
[MICHAEL] No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
[MICHAEL] And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
[MICHAEL] You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job! Rapport!
[MICHAEL] Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
[MICHAEL] Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way.
[MICHAEL] All right, see you at one.
[MICHAEL] I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
[MICHAEL] Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
[MICHAEL] Uh,  "I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."
[MICHAEL] OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
[MICHAEL] Um, what do you play? Center?
[MICHAEL] Uh...
[MICHAEL] Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
[MICHAEL] Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
[MICHAEL] Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
[MICHAEL] I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] No, no, ridiculous.
[MICHAEL] Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Sorry Phyllis.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm team captain.
[MICHAEL] No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
[MICHAEL] Threat neutralized.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah right.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
[MICHAEL] Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
[MICHAEL] Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] OK. Cool, you're on.  Don't screw this up.
[MICHAEL] All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
[MICHAEL] Aw, come on Dwight.
[MICHAEL] On. Just put it on.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?
[MICHAEL] Stanley! What? You gotta be kidding me! !?!  Oh... Here we go!  Who's on him? Somebody get him!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here.  Here we go. Three!  Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!
[MICHAEL] Who's got Roy?
[MICHAEL] OK, I'll take it.  OK.
[MICHAEL] That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
[MICHAEL] Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
[MICHAEL] You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
[MICHAEL] All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
[MICHAEL] All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
[MICHAEL] Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
[MICHAEL] Dwight!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, baby, here we go!
[MICHAEL] Foul! Foul!
[MICHAEL] Oh, that hurts.
[MICHAEL] What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
[MICHAEL] Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair.
[MICHAEL] Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.
[MICHAEL] Thanks Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won.
[MICHAEL] It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
[MICHAEL] Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so...
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey...
[MICHAEL] You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
[MICHAEL] Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
[MICHAEL] Affirmative.
[MICHAEL] You just said, let me uh... check my notes. You just said...
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey how is Alan? Tell Alan that the Mets suck! Okay? From me, big time. Go Pirates!
[MICHAEL] Okay
[MICHAEL] Uh, huh.
[MICHAEL] Whoa. Howdy-ho. Wow, a thousand big ones. That's cool. Do I uh, do I get to pick the prize?
[MICHAEL] Um, question: Does top salesman include uh, people who were at one time such outstanding salesman that've been promoted to...
[MICHAEL] I didn't mean me!
[MICHAEL] It's illegal. Can't do that. Next best thing.
[MICHAEL] Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid.
[MICHAEL] Pam!
[MICHAEL] Burger with cheese!
[MICHAEL] And fries!
[MICHAEL] And shake! What? Go ahead.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. No vendors in the office. That is a distraction.
[MICHAEL] Pam. Pam. Come on, I'm busy. So just tell her to go away.
[MICHAEL] Oooh, alright I'll talk to her.
[MICHAEL] All right girls break it up, you're being infiltrated. Cock in the henhouse.
[MICHAEL] Don't say cocks. Oh, what is your name, my fair lass?
[MICHAEL] Ah, Katy. Wow. Look at you. You are, uh you're like the new and improved Pam. Pam 6.0.
[MICHAEL] Nobody cares what you think.
[MICHAEL] So uh, you know what? I usually don't allow solicitors in the office but today I am going to break some rules, and you can have the conference room. It's yours. All day.
[MICHAEL] Well, lets put 'em in the hallway. Give 'em some chairs. Right? Decisiveness. One of the keys to success according to Small Businessman.
[MICHAEL] Wait a second. I should have spotted another addict. Uh, gotta love the 'bucks.
[MICHAEL] It's like a slang for Starbucks. They're all over the place. Oh, man, that place is like the promised land to me. What a business model too. Ah, too bad we don't have the good stuff here.
[MICHAEL] Nah, it's not. it's spppplllibbb
[MICHAEL] No, here's the thing. Y'know I do my best to be my own man and go by the beat of a different drummer and nobody gets me, and they're always putting up walls and I'm always tearing 'em down, just breakin' down barriers, that's what I do all day. So a coffee, regular coffee for you. High test, or unleaded?
[MICHAEL] Oh. Woo, I will. I will bring it on. Ah, all right.
[MICHAEL] I have an idea. Why don't I introduce you around, you know you can kind of get your foot in the door, meet potential clientele, right?
[MICHAEL] Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, bladdy-bluda-blah-blah. Techno-babble. Just do it, okay. We have company. Right?
[MICHAEL] Oooh-ooh. Oscar the grouch. Right? I thought of that.
[MICHAEL] I know. I know. I made the connection. Can you believe he'd never heard that before he worked here?
[MICHAEL] I know, it's unbelievable.
[MICHAEL] Toby, Katy.
[MICHAEL] Toby's divorced. He uh, guh recently, right?
[MICHAEL] You and your wife, and you have kids.
[MICHAEL] Oh that so - that was really messy. He slept one night in your car too?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Alright. Cool. See ya in a bit.  Oh, she's cute. Cutie-pie. Back to work.
[MICHAEL] Giggle-giggle, juji-juji, I get it, I get it. Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood over here right?  So how's that uh, coffee from earlier?
[MICHAEL] Ah, I knew it. Guzzled it down. You greedy little thing. So, uh, Pam is this your lunch break, or was that earlier when you were eating in the kitchen with those guys?
[MICHAEL] Busted.
[MICHAEL] Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something. I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones.
[MICHAEL] Yes. This is a Starbucks digital barista. This is the mack daddy of espresso makers.
[MICHAEL] Oh, I know what you're thinking. You're not prying this out of my hands, but don't tempt me because I'll give it to you!
[MICHAEL] Oh, oh! God. I'm sorry. Is there...?
[MICHAEL] Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
[MICHAEL] Seriously. No, really.
[MICHAEL] God! No, no, no, no. No inconvenience. I mean I'm out of here at five sharp.
[MICHAEL] I can go earlier. 'Cause I'm the boss. You know, whatever. I'm out of here slaves.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Sounds good. Sounds good. Five o'clock sharp. I will give you and your purses a ride home.
[MICHAEL] Excellent.
[MICHAEL] Great. Cool. Cool.  Yeah, okay.
[MICHAEL] No it's not. Because I could just click on the icon and then I'm onto---
[MICHAEL] No, no, no it's not against the rules. She's not a permanent employee so it's not.
[MICHAEL] But I think you should just know that I am going to be giving her a ride home later.
[MICHAEL] She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home.
[MICHAEL] Well, might be a ride home. Might be a ride home and we stop for coffee and dot-dot-dot...
[MICHAEL] No. I cannot promise you that.
[MICHAEL] Listen, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, no. I don't know. It's too early to tell. I don't know how I feel.
[MICHAEL] Espresso?
[MICHAEL] You're welcome. Thank you. Hmmm-hmm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] Ummm-hmmm...
[MICHAEL] Very easy to clean.
[MICHAEL] Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
[MICHAEL] Would you like to help me with a special project?
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Um, yes. Throw them away in the recycling bin.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Uh, what flavor?
[MICHAEL] Blue's not a flavor.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Blue Blast. Yes, put that in the trunk, and there should be an unopened Arctic Chill back there. I want that in the passengers cupholder. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] No, it is a perfect smell-alike. I'm not paying for the label. Right here. Give it.
[MICHAEL] Not it's not, there's some in the straw.  There, now you may throw it out.
[MICHAEL] That's over several months, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] See you later. Goodnight. Goodnight, Jim.
[MICHAEL] Where you going?
[MICHAEL] With us?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Great. Off the hook. Excellent. Okay, cool.
[MICHAEL] Alright, have fun.
[MICHAEL] Don't drink and drive.
[MICHAEL] You too, have a good night.
[MICHAEL] Fat Halpert.  Jim Halpert.
[MICHAEL] Oh, that's a good idea.
[MICHAEL] Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no you di-int.
[MICHAEL] W-why did you...
[MICHAEL] Yes we should. I... you know what? I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.
[MICHAEL] He has the award-ah! ...it's a type of song that we are going to play for the ladies. Hit it, Dwight!
[MICHAEL] ...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
[MICHAEL] Well, you could take the bus. You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
[MICHAEL] Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
[MICHAEL] Um...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
[MICHAEL] Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
[MICHAEL] No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
[MICHAEL] ...it happens once every billion years.
[MICHAEL] Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
[MICHAEL] Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
[MICHAEL] Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
[MICHAEL] That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.
[MICHAEL] Oh,  lazy. Uh huh.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
[MICHAEL] Just don't, don't talk-
[MICHAEL] Don't talk-
[MICHAEL] Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
[MICHAEL] Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards.  I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
[MICHAEL] Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.
[MICHAEL] I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.
[MICHAEL] No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
[MICHAEL] And I was about to take her bra off...
[MICHAEL] ...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
[MICHAEL] No!  God.
[MICHAEL] What? I told them busiest...idiots.
[MICHAEL] Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.
[MICHAEL] Oh, dat wir be fwar. Ah, me so horny.
[MICHAEL] Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke.
[MICHAEL] I don't know, it's just...
[MICHAEL] I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
[MICHAEL] Just sit down Kelly.
[MICHAEL] Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?
[MICHAEL] Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...
[MICHAEL] Let's cut it.
[MICHAEL] Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
[MICHAEL] You know you did.
[MICHAEL] Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman.  Oh! Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Excellent.
[MICHAEL] Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
[MICHAEL] Any emails today?
[MICHAEL] No? Um... Check your spam folder.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Kay.
[MICHAEL] That's funny! That's funny. Not offensive. Uh... because it's nature. Educational.
[MICHAEL] Um, I...
[MICHAEL] Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's...  Whup! Come on! Hey!
[MICHAEL] Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Uh oh.
[MICHAEL] Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
[MICHAEL] Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah.
[MICHAEL] Well, to be fair... blondes, brunettes, you know, there's a lot of dumb people out there.
[MICHAEL] Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Bad boy.  Um... Ryan?
[MICHAEL] Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
[MICHAEL] Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School".
[MICHAEL] Yes, Toby?
[MICHAEL] Um... literally two seconds?
[MICHAEL] No, no, Toby. No.
[MICHAEL] It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] NO!
[MICHAEL] What? He! No! Okay, what is a lawyer going to come in and tell us? To not send out hilarious emails or not tell jokes?
[MICHAEL] There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
[MICHAEL] I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
[MICHAEL] Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day.
[MICHAEL] Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
[MICHAEL] Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] I don't feel bad.
[MICHAEL] No, I don't.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Hi, is it over?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
[MICHAEL] Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
[MICHAEL] Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
[MICHAEL] Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
[MICHAEL] I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
[MICHAEL] No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was?
[MICHAEL] She would have definitely slept with me.
[MICHAEL] Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
[MICHAEL] What if they made out? In front of everybody?
[MICHAEL] At home? And I told everybody everything about it.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
[MICHAEL] That's what she said. Pam?
[MICHAEL] That's what she sai  Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
[MICHAEL] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
[MICHAEL] Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
[MICHAEL] The problem is that I am the boss and apparently I can't say anything.
[MICHAEL] Where's the line? Where's the line, Jan.
[MICHAEL] No, I've seen the video.
[MICHAEL] No, I didn't.  Huh, what?
[MICHAEL] Mmmhmm. Yes.
[MICHAEL] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!
[MICHAEL] Come on.
[MICHAEL] Mwah!
[MICHAEL] It's... That's...
[MICHAEL] Okay.  Hello.  Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
[MICHAEL] I believe you may recognize his face from the billboards. He specializes in Free Speech issues.
[MICHAEL] This guy does it all.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] So I'm not in trouble?
[MICHAEL] I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
[MICHAEL] No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.
[MICHAEL] Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
[MICHAEL] No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
[MICHAEL] I don't know about that.
[MICHAEL] Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
[MICHAEL] Yes, your corner. Go.
[MICHAEL] Mmmhmmm.
[MICHAEL] They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  C'mere, c'mere, c'mon! Come on! Come on.
[MICHAEL] Oooh!
[MICHAEL] I'm not worried.
[MICHAEL] You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
[MICHAEL] Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
[MICHAEL] Ok.  Healthier. Gotta watch those carbs.
[MICHAEL] Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
[MICHAEL] Maybe.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough.
[MICHAEL] Sign the papers at the condo.
[MICHAEL] Uh, I don't need one.
[MICHAEL] I don't need a representative.
[MICHAEL] No, No.
[MICHAEL] No. Dwight. I'm fine.
[MICHAEL] Well, this isn't about work. This is closing on a condo, it's completely personal.
[MICHAEL] Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
[MICHAEL] As my associate.
[MICHAEL] No it is not.
[MICHAEL] We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
[MICHAEL] Very good.
[MICHAEL] We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
[MICHAEL] Good. The Small Business Man?
[MICHAEL] Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
[MICHAEL] How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
[MICHAEL] Ok. See you soon.
[MICHAEL] I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] What? No, Dwight. It's fifty degrees outside. Don't... please...
[MICHAEL] I... Just... Would you put it up?  Ok. Fine. Just leave it down. Whiner.
[MICHAEL] I do not understand what you spend your money on.
[MICHAEL] Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
[MICHAEL] Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something.
[MICHAEL] Nice to meet you too.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that.
[MICHAEL] I'm putting my bed right over here.
[MICHAEL] Well, then I will get a warrantee.
[MICHAEL] Well then I won't get a warrantee.
[MICHAEL] So that's the problem, is solved. What?
[MICHAEL] Uh... Ten year.
[MICHAEL] What? Wha? You said ten.
[MICHAEL] Ok, ok, ok.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Alright. Oh boy.
[MICHAEL] Um. Oh.  Oh, ok. Is that suppose to come off?
[MICHAEL] Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me.
[MICHAEL] Oh, man.
[MICHAEL] Uh.
[MICHAEL] ...know if you showed me this same unit or not.
[MICHAEL] Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
[MICHAEL] As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no.
[MICHAEL] I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin.
[MICHAEL] Ehhhh....
[MICHAEL] No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
[MICHAEL] I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone.
[MICHAEL] What the hell is a terrarium?
[MICHAEL] Oh, so an aquarium. Ah, that will not come into this place.
[MICHAEL] We take separate cars.
[MICHAEL] Why would we do that?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
[MICHAEL] Nobody likes beets.
[MICHAEL] Nobody likes beets, Dwight. Why don't you grow something that everybody does like? You should grow candy. I'd love a piece of candy right now. Not a beet.
[MICHAEL] Stop it!
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
[MICHAEL] Oh. Thanks. Thanks. It's very cool. It's a three bedroom, gay-friendly.
[MICHAEL] You know.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment.
[MICHAEL] Get up here, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Yep, not as good as gold.  Why are you playing the national anthem?
[MICHAEL] Oh.  What the hell is that?
[MICHAEL] Shall we? Let us proceed. First up, proficiency in necessary skills. Aaaaeeexcellent!
[MICHAEL] Oh! Good. Ambitious. Excellent. Want to be a manager?
[MICHAEL] That is ridiculous.
[MICHAEL] Mmm... No. That was Yoda.
[MICHAEL] And I will give you the rest of the ten at lunch.
[MICHAEL] Adapt. React. Re-adapt. Act. All right? That's rule number two.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well, let's... . let's kind of take it a little slower.
[MICHAEL] Okay, uh, well, one is taken.
[MICHAEL] Well, he needs a permanent number, right?
[MICHAEL] Um, yeah. Okay. That... No, no, no. I got one. I got one. The Three Stooges.
[MICHAEL] Wow, some pretty big books back there, huh?
[MICHAEL] Hello, Mr. Egghead! Woop! So... oh, Stanley Kaplan! I know him. 'M' is for Murder, 'P' is for...
[MICHAEL] ...for Phone. What?
[MICHAEL] Um, oh, thinking about business school?
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] So you think you know a lot about business?
[MICHAEL] Uh huh.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Quiz me.
[MICHAEL] Come on, egghead. Let's do it.
[MICHAEL] Quiz me up.
[MICHAEL] Uh...
[MICHAEL] Shut, it. Can I... can I just do it please?  Uh, it's equal.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Yes! It was a trick question.
[MICHAEL] Okay, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] You know what, Dwight? You don't need to help me here. Okay? Well, you know... Maybe you should go to business school like Ryan, then... then you'd know what you're talking about.
[MICHAEL] For instance, why don't you go to business...
[MICHAEL] Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will.
[MICHAEL] You are so smart. You are so eff-in' smart. You should be teaching me.
[MICHAEL] Nah, I'm okay.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey. Game, what game are we playing here?
[MICHAEL] Oh, I play this at home all the time while I'm falling asleep. What, uh... . Where are we? Where are we here? Mmm.. Roy? Roy? Who would you do, Roy?
[MICHAEL] Aaaall right. Who's next, who's next, who's next, who's? Jim? You're next. Who would you do?
[MICHAEL] Well, I would definitely have s*x with Ryan. 'Cause he is going to own his own business.
[MICHAEL] Who's, uh... Who's next? Who we got? Whooo...
[MICHAEL] Wish I had my cell phone, but I left it inside. So...
[MICHAEL] What's that?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Dwight. Hey!
[MICHAEL] Dwight, don't! He is an idiot. The man is an idiot, ladies and gentlemen.
[MICHAEL] I didn't say it to him. I said it about him.
[MICHAEL] How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
[MICHAEL] Seriously, where the hell is Dwight? Hey, call my cell phone. It'll make it easier for him to find.
[MICHAEL] I gave it to you in the car.
[MICHAEL] I saw you program it in.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Alright.
[MICHAEL] Uh, I better tell somebody.  Excuse me, sir...
[MICHAEL] Wow. Okay. Well, I guess they don't teach how to operate a toaster oven in business school.
[MICHAEL] Hey, did you miss that day there, Ryan?
[MICHAEL] Toaster Oven 101?
[MICHAEL] ...since the world was turning.
[MICHAEL] Ohh... OK.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.
[MICHAEL] I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
[MICHAEL] Okay... Sherri?
[MICHAEL] If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
[MICHAEL] Thanks.
[MICHAEL] I'll call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.
[MICHAEL] Okay! I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] No?
[MICHAEL] Bye.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yeeesh.
[MICHAEL] Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
[MICHAEL] Because it's very scary stuff.
[MICHAEL] You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
[MICHAEL] No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
[MICHAEL] And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
[MICHAEL] I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.
[MICHAEL] Oh, man. Okay, I have to fire somebody.
[MICHAEL] You guys excited about the party?
[MICHAEL] It's gonna be fun.
[MICHAEL] Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
[MICHAEL] All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
[MICHAEL] Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?
[MICHAEL] Good. Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
[MICHAEL] Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
[MICHAEL] "Bend It Like Beckham."
[MICHAEL] Yeah. That would be perfect.
[MICHAEL] Well, I don't really have two heads. So...
[MICHAEL] No, Jim brings in money.
[MICHAEL] Eh.
[MICHAEL] What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
[MICHAEL] You're right, I didn't even think of him.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
[MICHAEL] Yeah... I could.
[MICHAEL] I'm not saying that's what he said.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding?
[MICHAEL] I agree. He'd land on his feet.
[MICHAEL] Ahh, come on.
[MICHAEL] I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just...
[MICHAEL] Oh, God.
[MICHAEL] Fantastic!
[MICHAEL] What?! That would've solved all my problems.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you idiot.
[MICHAEL] If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
[MICHAEL] Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?
[MICHAEL] You can call. Can you call 'em?
[MICHAEL] Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
[MICHAEL] Can I speak to you a minute?
[MICHAEL] Help. Me.
[MICHAEL] I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.
[MICHAEL] Yes, that's a good idea.
[MICHAEL] Aaaahh! I'm gonna kill myself!
[MICHAEL] I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!
[MICHAEL] Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
[MICHAEL] I... this is Creed.
[MICHAEL] I'm improvising, so just try to keep up.
[MICHAEL] And I'm very angry, and I want...
[MICHAEL] I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
[MICHAEL] Get off, get off. No, no. OK.. just get off. Just, just... yeah.
[MICHAEL] Could I talk to you for a second?
[MICHAEL] I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
[MICHAEL] No, you wanna leave.
[MICHAEL] Why... why are you making this so hard?
[MICHAEL] I think you're right.
[MICHAEL] No, of course you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.
[MICHAEL] Hmm?
[MICHAEL] What old days? What are you talking about?
[MICHAEL] It's right here on the desk, yeah.
[MICHAEL] I can't, I can't...
[MICHAEL] I can't change anything. This is the way...
[MICHAEL] I don't... okay, just listen.
[MICHAEL] Don't...
[MICHAEL] Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
[MICHAEL] Don't...
[MICHAEL] Well, he...
[MICHAEL] Well, maybe I did.
[MICHAEL] Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and...
[MICHAEL] I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
[MICHAEL] Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
[MICHAEL] He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
[MICHAEL] You look great! And you're a princess?
[MICHAEL] A fairy princess. You're very... .
[MICHAEL] You're a lion.  Wow, I want to hear your, your... Oh!  Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
[MICHAEL] Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
[MICHAEL] Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
[MICHAEL] Yes, thank you. I know where to sign.
[MICHAEL] Last year they were out of order, weren't they Pam?
[MICHAEL] Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
[MICHAEL] Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority." Think. Think with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are cool they walk all over you.
[MICHAEL] Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?
[MICHAEL] Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
[MICHAEL] This is Tito.
[MICHAEL] Calling from...
[MICHAEL] Pick up.
[MICHAEL] This is Mike Tyson.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah, I don't think that would happen.
[MICHAEL] Because I would kick his ass.
[MICHAEL] So? I've beaten up black belts.
[MICHAEL] They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.
[MICHAEL] You were a Jet?
[MICHAEL] Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link.
[MICHAEL] Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah, that would be kind of worthless because I know a ton of fourteen year old girls who can kick his ass.
[MICHAEL] Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'...
[MICHAEL] ... he cried at the end of it. He did.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Bruce Willis. Are they going to leave him on the asteroid?
[MICHAEL] Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
[MICHAEL] Fuuuaaaahhhhh... oohhhhh!
[MICHAEL] Yeah.  Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Go away.
[MICHAEL] I haven't signed them, ok?
[MICHAEL] Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough.
[MICHAEL] Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him.
[MICHAEL] Oh, so that's what they are saying?
[MICHAEL] Ok, alright, where is Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
[MICHAEL] No, Really?
[MICHAEL] Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22.
[MICHAEL] Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two punches: me punching you and you hitting the floor.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
[MICHAEL] No, they must have class.
[MICHAEL] Look...
[MICHAEL] Hey, Toby.
[MICHAEL] I've got an idea: why don't you leave right now. Why don't you walk away from the room, 'kay? Fine. We'll go at lunch. Pam, make an announcement. Figure out carpools.
[MICHAEL] I think it is. A guy told me about that.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner.
[MICHAEL] Hey!
[MICHAEL] What the hell was that?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Alright, that's the way you want it.
[MICHAEL] Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man.
[MICHAEL] I'm comin' atcha man. Ok, purple belt, ok. I got him.
[MICHAEL] I got his pants.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, you have... No, you have something... God, you look like such an idiot!
[MICHAEL] Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
[MICHAEL] You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.  Eight points. Nine points.
[MICHAEL] Open your mouth.
[MICHAEL] Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya?
[MICHAEL] He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, just throw them on the chair. I'll take it from here. So, whatcha up to this weekend?
[MICHAEL] If you're doing anything crazy, give me a shout.
[MICHAEL] Alright, bye.
[MICHAEL] This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
[MICHAEL] Well,  busier. Making the time.
[MICHAEL] Well, you don't even have anyone to go home to, Toby.
[MICHAEL] I know, but I've been carrying the load on my back all day, and if everybody would just chip in a little bit, it'd might help me out. What do you say? Let's g*ngb*ng this thing and go home. Good? Dwight.
[MICHAEL] And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know, I know, I wouldn't be offering it if I didn't think you could handle it.
[MICHAEL] No, no, title change only.
[MICHAEL] No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
[MICHAEL] Absolutely but not really.
[MICHAEL] Yes you do.
[MICHAEL] And, ditto.
[MICHAEL] Wow, graphs and charts, somebody's really been doing their homework. Looks like USA Today.
[MICHAEL] I changed it. To Chili's.
[MICHAEL] Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson". It's kind of snooty. So.
[MICHAEL] Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course. It's where business happens. Small Businessman Magazine.
[MICHAEL] It will. I sent it in. Letter to the editor.
[MICHAEL] Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip.
[MICHAEL] Kiss ass. Ok, probably going to go late tonight. Burning the midnight tequila. So, I think you could all just take off now.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] No, no. That would not be efficient. Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.  That's not true. I know how to delegate, and they do more work done when I'm not here. Not more. The same amount of work is done, whether I am here or not.  Hey, everybody, listen up. This is what we're gonna do. You sit tight, until I return. Sound good? Doesn't matter, it's an order. Follow it blindly, mwahahaha, ok? Alright, ciao.  Adios!
[MICHAEL] Uh, I'll drive.
[MICHAEL] It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?
[MICHAEL] At all!
[MICHAEL] You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
[MICHAEL] Dar de dar.
[MICHAEL] Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
[MICHAEL] Well, I... it could be either of us.
[MICHAEL] Yeees.
[MICHAEL] Thought that was you. Hi. Michael Scott. This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
[MICHAEL] No Gould?
[MICHAEL] Uh, Jan, what happened?
[MICHAEL] Is Gould dead? What uh-
[MICHAEL] Wow, you're kidding me! Do you wanna talk about?
[MICHAEL] When did this happen?
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Alright, after you.
[MICHAEL] Awesome blossom.
[MICHAEL] I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say? They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
[MICHAEL] Ok, it's done. Actually,  Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome? Now it's done.
[MICHAEL] I heard a-
[MICHAEL] Very very funny joke the other day. Wanna hear it?
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Just one joke. Ok. Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke. Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
[MICHAEL] Pam, it's Michael. I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Nope. Told it. Not as good as you think. Pick another one.
[MICHAEL] Oh ho ho, yea! Bingo! And a lighthouse. Yes. That is hysterical. Could you start that one from the beginning?
[MICHAEL] Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
[MICHAEL] I want my baby back, baby back, baby back
[MICHAEL] Chili's baby back ribs...
[MICHAEL] Woo, well, this brings us to Jan. Truth or Dare? Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
[MICHAEL] Oh, so you're not gonna play? She's not playing.
[MICHAEL] She's not playing the game.
[MICHAEL] Check please.
[MICHAEL] No, you were not stupid. Gould was stupid. Right?
[MICHAEL] You know?
[MICHAEL] It's true.
[MICHAEL] Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised. Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'. I know this place. I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have. It's home, you know? I know the challenges this county's up against. Here's the thing about those discount suppliers. They don't care. They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
[MICHAEL] It's bad.
[MICHAEL] It, you know what, it really is.
[MICHAEL] Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
[MICHAEL] We did it!
[MICHAEL] Nailed it. Nailed it! Come here.
[MICHAEL] What!?
[MICHAEL] Goin'. Ok. Where we goin'? Doesn't matter. Goin' to the go go.  Oh-ok.
[MICHAEL] Who.
[MICHAEL] Uh, no, no, no Gould.
[MICHAEL] This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
[MICHAEL] And she is a woman. She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman. And you know what? I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.  Jan, I defend your honor.  Is that all?
[MICHAEL] And a woman-
[MICHAEL] And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you. I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews. I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon." First impressions?
[MICHAEL] But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion". That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Yeah, what, what?
[MICHAEL] Ohhh, great. Well, now I'm in a terrible mood. Let's do your performance review-
[MICHAEL] Ah, why, that's great news? That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow, wow. Alright, let's listen to that again.  "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you".
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? Sorry.
[MICHAEL] No kidding.
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
[MICHAEL] Jan! To what do I owe this pleasure?
[MICHAEL] Well, hello to you, too. Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
[MICHAEL] Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Been thinking about you.
[MICHAEL] Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] They are not. Yes, they are.  That's my girlfriend.
[MICHAEL] That's unfortunate. How 'bout the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.
[MICHAEL] The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously? Maybe there's prizes?
[MICHAEL] Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them. Hello, everybody? Yeah, uh, attention, please. Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
[MICHAEL] What did I say?
[MICHAEL] Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions. 'K?
[MICHAEL] Hi, Jan. How are you?
[MICHAEL] Good to see you.
[MICHAEL] Ok.  Ok, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here.
[MICHAEL] Yep, right after you. Apres-vous.  No calls.
[MICHAEL] It's nice to see you.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Oh, well.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] Absolutely.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, I finished all of that. I'm very fast. I'm not too fast. Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am. But I do say thank ya ma'am. But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam. Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam. If it's consensual.  We're talking about office stuff. Can I ask you a question?
[MICHAEL] This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.
[MICHAEL] Are you wearing a new perfume today?
[MICHAEL] Well, you're wearing it at the office. And  it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.
[MICHAEL] I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
[MICHAEL] I did not, not, not use those words.
[MICHAEL] No, it's in like ten minutes.
[MICHAEL] Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally.
[MICHAEL] And, um, one down. Next suggestion: "we need better outreach for employees fighting depression". Ok, alright, enough with the jokes. Nobody in here is suffering from depression.
[MICHAEL] Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
[MICHAEL] Tom. Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
[MICHAEL] Oh, that guy? That guy was weird. Alright, next suggestion.
[MICHAEL] Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O."
[MICHAEL] Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion. Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
[MICHAEL] Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
[MICHAEL] Was I, Creed?! Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank. Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of. Ok? Now that we've learned this, let's continue. See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out. "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, is that hard for you? Alright, well-
[MICHAEL] I'll work on that-
[MICHAEL] Let's keep going. Keep it going. Yep. What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum. Somebody put a piece of gum in there. This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company. This is not a place for gum. I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
[MICHAEL] "Don't sl-", ok, that's blank  Don't, just put it-
[MICHAEL] I don't understand why you're so upset.
[MICHAEL] Let me ask you-
[MICHAEL] Ok, let me ask you this.
[MICHAEL] Let me ask you something.
[MICHAEL] Where did you get your outfit?
[MICHAEL] Look-
[MICHAEL] Oh my God...
[MICHAEL] What do you want Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Ok, great. Your performance has been adequate. You may leave; goodbye.
[MICHAEL] You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.
[MICHAEL] Why on earth would we give you a raise?
[MICHAEL] You do? How do you get in?
[MICHAEL] That is a serious offense. Very serious. As is toying with a man's heart.
[MICHAEL] Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?
[MICHAEL] That was deer!? Gross, oh!
[MICHAEL] Oh, did not!
[MICHAEL] What do you say, Jan?
[MICHAEL] Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
[MICHAEL] That's from Superman?
[MICHAEL] Wait.
[MICHAEL] Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
[MICHAEL] Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?
[MICHAEL] Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
[MICHAEL] I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
[MICHAEL] Am I too short?
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] I appreciate that, thank you.
[MICHAEL] No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-
[MICHAEL] So my looks have nothing to do with it?
[MICHAEL] Never missed a day, my ass.
[MICHAEL] There's no time to think about if this is real. Just, shh, everybody.
[MICHAEL] Oh...
[MICHAEL] Oh, umm...
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] AH! Guh-oood.
[MICHAEL] Please don't do that.
[MICHAEL] I can't tell you.
[MICHAEL] I don't have to tell you anything.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok? I'm in the best shape of my life. Look at this.  Brrr! That's strong!
[MICHAEL] I'm not going get a brain-
[MICHAEL] Stop it.
[MICHAEL] Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok? Why don't you just go... away?
[MICHAEL] Try "profits". No! Try "Michael Scott". "Michael" "boss" and "funny".  Oh my God, wow!  E-mail from Stanley. Stanley, Terribly nice guy.  "Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late." Well, Stanley's an ass. Not one of our harder workers.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy! What other ghost stories do you have for us? That I'm a robot?  I will destroy everything in my path-
[MICHAEL] Beep! Bop!
[MICHAEL] Bommmm. Bop! Onk onk.  Oil can. Oil can.
[MICHAEL] Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
[MICHAEL] You know what the problem is?
[MICHAEL] The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
[MICHAEL] Of course. Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of. Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles. This is a meal in a cup.
[MICHAEL] Hot, tasty. Reminds me of college. Lived on this stuff. Brain food. Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college? The parties. Everybody'd go. The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
[MICHAEL] Yeah! They were the most fun. We always invited them.
[MICHAEL] Hey there.
[MICHAEL] Almost quittin' time.
[MICHAEL] One more hour. Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
[MICHAEL] You have plans.
[MICHAEL] I do, too. I do, too.
[MICHAEL] I do, yeah. Big plans.
[MICHAEL] Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no. Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] It's the best. It's the best. I would not miss it for the world. But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
[MICHAEL] It is. Ok.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Alright. Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
[MICHAEL] Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight? Where are you off to?
[MICHAEL] Ok, alright.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy. Where you rushin' off to?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well duh. Where ya headed?
[MICHAEL] Liar!
[MICHAEL] You are a liar.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre. You and I are hangin' tonight. The two of us. We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood. You know what? Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
[MICHAEL] That's, whatever stupid show you want-
[MICHAEL] To watch tonight
[MICHAEL] We're watching it.
[MICHAEL] I didn't know you played soccer, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] You, too, Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.
[MICHAEL] Boom! Detective Michael Scarn. I'm with the FBI.
[MICHAEL] Boom! Freeze! Michael Scoon, FBI. You know what you did. Boom! Boom! Boom!  Yeah, you thought that you could get away with your little ruse, didn't you? Didn't ya!? Well, you didn't, because I know where ya hid the diamonds. I been on to you and your little friends for weeks.  Boom! Boom! Boom!
[MICHAEL] Boom! Boom!
[MICHAEL] Boom! Boom!
[MICHAEL] Why
[MICHAEL] Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.
[MICHAEL] Boring.
[MICHAEL] I could of-
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Yehhhehh.
[MICHAEL] I'm in.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
[MICHAEL] What are you...
[MICHAEL] Nothing.
[MICHAEL] Good, it's good. Good work, everybody.
[MICHAEL] So Bernie's, huh? We're all going to Bernie's?  Go to Bernie's?
[MICHAEL] Right, right, right. Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party. A big office party I need to go to, so... Can't get out of it.
[MICHAEL] Ok, see you later. Nice job, Bill. Not.
[MICHAEL] Wow! Who opened the morgue for this thing? I'm just driving by, thought I'd drop in.  There's some wine. I would love a glass, if you're gonna open it. Here ya go Temp, take my jacket!  Oh, come on! That guy? He is a good guy, not a terrorist. Karaoke, I love it! I am a karaoke fiend. I call dibs. I got next, I got next up. Come on, let's get this party started, ha! Ok? Where's that wine?
[MICHAEL] We're making love!
[MICHAEL] Shut up!
[MICHAEL] Here we are.
[MICHAEL] Oh god.
[MICHAEL] No, no, turn it around.
[MICHAEL] You'll break it.
[MICHAEL] You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh?
[MICHAEL] On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
[MICHAEL] Merry Christmas!
[MICHAEL] A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
[MICHAEL] Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.
[MICHAEL] Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
[MICHAEL] You wanna be Santa?
[MICHAEL] Have you ever seen Santa?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.
[MICHAEL] That makes sense because he has elfish features.
[MICHAEL] Yeah? Who did you have?
[MICHAEL] I think I got something pretty nice for my guy.
[MICHAEL] I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
[MICHAEL] It was Ryan. Yeah. I have Ryan.
[MICHAEL] All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
[MICHAEL] Not great.
[MICHAEL] No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.
[MICHAEL] No, don't!
[MICHAEL] Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
[MICHAEL] You don't know that.
[MICHAEL] I did?
[MICHAEL] What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
[MICHAEL] Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on.
[MICHAEL] An oven mitt? Okay.
[MICHAEL] I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
[MICHAEL] One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
[MICHAEL] Well, I call it fun!
[MICHAEL] Because it's better. Because it's more special.
[MICHAEL] Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.
[MICHAEL] Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
[MICHAEL] I think this is going great.
[MICHAEL] I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.
[MICHAEL] Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
[MICHAEL] Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
[MICHAEL] Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
[MICHAEL] Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
[MICHAEL] It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.
[MICHAEL] All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?
[MICHAEL] Cool, cool. Box it up.
[MICHAEL] This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
[MICHAEL] Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
[MICHAEL] Go, here we go!
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. We'll find some, don't leave the party.
[MICHAEL] Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
[MICHAEL] Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.
[MICHAEL] Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Merry Christmas.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, that sounds good.
[MICHAEL] Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
[MICHAEL] Okay!
[MICHAEL] Ah! Ha ha ha!
[MICHAEL] Stanley! Bo banley.
[MICHAEL] Banana fana fo fanley.
[MICHAEL] Be my mo manley.
[MICHAEL] Stanley.
[MICHAEL] Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?
[MICHAEL] Maybe, I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
[MICHAEL] It's cheaper.
[MICHAEL] No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] Well, this...
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] To throw you off the scent.
[MICHAEL] Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
[MICHAEL] Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
[MICHAEL] Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
[MICHAEL] All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
[MICHAEL] Titanic?
[MICHAEL] No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
[MICHAEL] No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
[MICHAEL] The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
[MICHAEL] I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!
[MICHAEL] Okay! So...
[MICHAEL] Right.
[MICHAEL] But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.
[MICHAEL] I'm your party captain too! And you are gonna put on your dancing shoes later on! So we are gonna...
[MICHAEL] Rock it!
[MICHAEL] If the boat's a-rockin', don't come knockin'!
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] We're all gonna have a good time tonight!
[MICHAEL] Hm? Okay. Yep.
[MICHAEL] Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
[MICHAEL] Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.
[MICHAEL] So, okay.
[MICHAEL] But before that, I have to do my presentation.
[MICHAEL] All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
[MICHAEL] Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?
[MICHAEL] No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.
[MICHAEL] Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing. Congratulations. That is great!
[MICHAEL] Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
[MICHAEL] Then I'll give you away!
[MICHAEL] Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
[MICHAEL] Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a...
[MICHAEL] It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.
[MICHAEL] Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
[MICHAEL] He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
[MICHAEL] Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
[MICHAEL] Roy said the first one didn't count.
[MICHAEL] Really? You're kidding me. You and Pam? Wow. I would have never have put you two together. You really hid it well. God! I usually have a radar for stuff like that. You know, I made out with Jan...
[MICHAEL] Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.
[MICHAEL] Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.
[MICHAEL] BFD. Engaged ain't married.
[MICHAEL] Never, ever, ever give up.
[MICHAEL] It's a fake wheel, dummy.
[MICHAEL] Pam! It's Michael. Help me! I need help right now.
[MICHAEL] I'm hurt, I have hurt myself. Oh my God!
[MICHAEL] Ungh, this is not looking good Pam!
[MICHAEL] No, I want you to pick me up.
[MICHAEL] I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
[MICHAEL] I want to come to work. But I need you to come and pick me up.
[MICHAEL] Oh God!
[MICHAEL] OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
[MICHAEL] Ok, could someone come and get me please, Ryan?
[MICHAEL] There's no toilet paper here. Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper. Could you tell 'em that?
[MICHAEL] I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance.
[MICHAEL] I'm not sick! I'm burned!
[MICHAEL] Don't... is that Dwight? I do not want Dwight.
[MICHAEL] I don't want Dwight!
[MICHAEL] I don't have a girlfriend.
[MICHAEL] It was all made up. Just someone come, ok? Anyone. Anyone but Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
[MICHAEL] Did you explain why?
[MICHAEL] Burned my foot, Pam.
[MICHAEL] Ha ha ha. So where are you shipping...
[MICHAEL] Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and...
[MICHAEL] No, your job is being my friend, Pam. OW! God!
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma. I don't think that's too much to ask.
[MICHAEL] No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy. Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing. I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
[MICHAEL] What? Part of your duties are to what?
[MICHAEL] You just said "part of your duties are to" something.
[MICHAEL] Yes, you did. What is wrong with you?
[MICHAEL] Thank you. Did you get all dark meat like I like?
[MICHAEL] Where are the yams?
[MICHAEL] Did you go to the one in Stroudsburg?
[MICHAEL] And they had no yams?
[MICHAEL] How strange. Because they always have yams.
[MICHAEL] Come here please.
[MICHAEL] I want you to rub butter on my foot.
[MICHAEL] Pam, please? I have Country Crock.
[MICHAEL] Uh, ow. Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
[MICHAEL] No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
[MICHAEL] I fell off the toilet. I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
[MICHAEL] Ugh, not you. Someone else. Get Pam.
[MICHAEL] Get Ryan. He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit. Bring a wet towel.
[MICHAEL] No, he's not.
[MICHAEL] I just saw him.
[MICHAEL] Ugh, forget it. I'll just get up myself. No! Uh, aaaahhh! Ah! Oh God!
[MICHAEL] Can I have everyone's attention please? Phyllis, Oscar, Ryan, who's supposed to be dead, can I ask you all a question? Do you all know what it's like to be disabled? Oscar?
[MICHAEL] Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.
[MICHAEL] Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?!
[MICHAEL] Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about. You people are jerks. Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
[MICHAEL] I burned my foot!!! Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
[MICHAEL] Good question. Forrest Gump: mentally challenged, Philadelphia : AIDS.
[MICHAEL] I don't think so, no.
[MICHAEL] He grew into a man overnight. Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
[MICHAEL] What you mean uh hmmm... ?
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Yes, right in here, come on in.
[MICHAEL] This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.
[MICHAEL] You are so brave. You are so brave.
[MICHAEL] But it's hard for you! Right? Because you're in a wheelchair.
[MICHAEL] Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?
[MICHAEL] Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.
[MICHAEL] Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.
[MICHAEL] Well they notice it. Don't you? You notice it. It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
[MICHAEL] Ok...
[MICHAEL] Ignore him. You know what? We're not that different, you and I. When I clamped my foot into a non-stick...
[MICHAEL] Yeah...
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] You did it! Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin. Very nice. Thank you, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] Did you get the yams?
[MICHAEL] Ok, I'll just have the pudding.
[MICHAEL] Yeh.
[MICHAEL] Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
[MICHAEL] Why don't you go with him?
[MICHAEL] I can't take you, I don't have my car and yours is all vomity.
[MICHAEL] Oh, ok, that's, great. No, I can't drive. Jim why don't you drive.
[MICHAEL] We'll go. I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
[MICHAEL] Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband. She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.
[MICHAEL] Chuck E. Cheese? Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
[MICHAEL] I know, just sayin'.
[MICHAEL] Give it to me.
[MICHAEL] Dwight...  You just keep your eyes on the road.  Give me the bottle or you're fired.
[MICHAEL] Give it to me Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Give me the bottle!!
[MICHAEL] Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
[MICHAEL] Just give it!
[MICHAEL] Stop, stop it! Stop spraying!  Gimme the bottle!
[MICHAEL] Stop spraying me! Gimme the bottle!
[MICHAEL] Something with a "K".
[MICHAEL] What do I write under "reason for visit"?
[MICHAEL] Nothing. I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital".
[MICHAEL] No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore. I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him.
[MICHAEL] Hi Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Doctor, what is more serious, a head injury or a foot injury?
[MICHAEL] Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
[MICHAEL] Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
[MICHAEL] Ok, what kinda machine is that?
[MICHAEL] That's my joke, damnit Dwight.
[MICHAEL] It's ok, they're with me.
[MICHAEL] Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
[MICHAEL] Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up. We'll, see you when you get out.
[MICHAEL] Fine. Fine.
[MICHAEL] Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.
[MICHAEL] What's up-dog?
[MICHAEL] Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!
[MICHAEL] I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?
[MICHAEL] No, damn it!
[MICHAEL] What does what mean?
[MICHAEL] Just forget it.
[MICHAEL] Gotcha!  Oh, God.  Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
[MICHAEL] Damn it.
[MICHAEL] No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] On a Friday?
[MICHAEL] I will do all the talking.
[MICHAEL] What difference does it make whether your here?
[MICHAEL] Hi, Oscar its Michael.
[MICHAEL] Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
[MICHAEL] Really? Oh, that is a shame. You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
[MICHAEL] What are your symptoms?
[MICHAEL] Umm, hmmm.
[MICHAEL] I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday. Unless you're still sick. So have a great long weekend.
[MICHAEL] He sounded sick.
[MICHAEL] That's exactly what I was thinking.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
[MICHAEL] Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time. It's much sexier.   Man, this must be torture for you.
[MICHAEL] Hey Jim-bag.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Who else knows?
[MICHAEL] Wow!
[MICHAEL] Can you hear me, they talk about us...
[MICHAEL] Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
[MICHAEL] Any of em? So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the "P" situation?
[MICHAEL] P-A-M. P-A
[MICHAEL] No it's okay, we're talking code.
[MICHAEL] Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
[MICHAEL] Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding?
[MICHAEL] Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
[MICHAEL] Not so much.
[MICHAEL] Nothing.
[MICHAEL] Fact: I love grape soda. I always have. Fact: Jim and I talk all the time. We tell each other secrets.
[MICHAEL] Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Good.
[MICHAEL] Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick. What are you doin' for lunch?
[MICHAEL] Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.
[MICHAEL] Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room. Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
[MICHAEL] I know just he place.
[MICHAEL] We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
[MICHAEL] I'm his boss actually. And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
[MICHAEL] Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
[MICHAEL] Mmmm, sounds yummy. I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
[MICHAEL] Is it her boobs, or...
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Never get's any of my jokes.
[MICHAEL] Her boobs, definitely.
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you.
[MICHAEL] Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
[MICHAEL] Woo! Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Thank you very much.
[MICHAEL] Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
[MICHAEL] Just do it.
[MICHAEL] No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, it's a business lunch.
[MICHAEL] No he did not. I don't need his permission.
[MICHAEL] Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity. How is that not work related?
[MICHAEL] You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged. So just cut me some slack. Please?
[MICHAEL] You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know, I know.
[MICHAEL] I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
[MICHAEL] Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
[MICHAEL] Yeah I'm good.
[MICHAEL] Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.
[MICHAEL] No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
[MICHAEL] It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
[MICHAEL] Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.
[MICHAEL] Hamster.
[MICHAEL] Welcome back! How was your vacation?
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Did you get lucky? Oh! Boink!
[MICHAEL] Wow! What happened in there?
[MICHAEL] There is stink in there, my God! What is... what is that?
[MICHAEL] Is it a bird?
[MICHAEL] Oh, God! How could that happen? How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
[MICHAEL] Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office.
[MICHAEL] Check it out.
[MICHAEL] Check it out. Don't be a wuss, just get... no, I'm not holding your coffee.
[MICHAEL] What is it?
[MICHAEL] What is it? No, just tell me what it is.
[MICHAEL] I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
[MICHAEL] How do you know that? What is it, then?
[MICHAEL] That is worse.
[MICHAEL] Hey Jim. I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
[MICHAEL] Oh... It's ...
[MICHAEL] Yeah ...
[MICHAEL] No, no, no! Seriously, I don't mind sharing.
[MICHAEL] Don't ape me.
[MICHAEL] This is great.
[MICHAEL] The pressures of my office are insane.
[MICHAEL] I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know? I used to sit right here.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Mm-mm. Todd Packer.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] He was, but, uh... that desk was empty. He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
[MICHAEL] Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay.
[MICHAEL] Charley horse!
[MICHAEL] Charley horse!
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay. Gah.
[MICHAEL] Let's send up Accounting.
[MICHAEL] Old fashioned raid. Sales on Accounting. Yeah. Follow my lead.
[MICHAEL] Ahem. What's up?
[MICHAEL] Yeah! Oh ho ho
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. We don't do that. We don't do that.
[MICHAEL] Watch out, Pam. You're next!
[MICHAEL] Maybe!
[MICHAEL] Stop.
[MICHAEL] Stop it.  Stop. It.  Don't. Don't.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] I'm just walking around.
[MICHAEL] Well, yeah.
[MICHAEL] Oh, and I'm not? Why would you say that? Because I'm having fun? You guys just are workin' for the weekend, aren't you? I'm workin' for the week. Sales team, listen to me. This is what we're gonna do. I'm gonna up the ante a little bit literally. Right here, I'm gonna put a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The person with the most sales at the end of the day gets to keep the cash. Sound good?
[MICHAEL] Seventy, eighty, one, two three. Eighty-three dollars. Still a lotta money and I'm going to ...  ... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it. I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest. Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?
[MICHAEL] Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
[MICHAEL] God, this is gonna be fun.
[MICHAEL] Nothing.
[MICHAEL] No. Just ...
[MICHAEL] You know what, guys? It's none of your concern. It was official business, so just...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, paper business. Is this done?
[MICHAEL] Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour. If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
[MICHAEL] You wanna talk about fair? Does anyone need to smell my old carpet? You explain to me how that was fair, and I'll explain to you how this is fair. Plus I just... I think that picking today was sort of taking advantage.
[MICHAEL] I am a victim of a hate crime. Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
[MICHAEL] Well I hated it! A lot! Okay, I... you know what? If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done .  Very well. Then you are all punished.
[MICHAEL] You're all on a time out. Just sit there quietly.  No. NO!
[MICHAEL] How would I know?
[MICHAEL] My biggest fear is turning into him.
[MICHAEL] I wasn't talking literally, Creed. Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy? Why am I talking to you?
[MICHAEL] Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, no, no. You're good. It was clerical. You're good. Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
[MICHAEL] I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Well, that figures. So how did you deal with people not liking you?
[MICHAEL] Well... s-sure I can.
[MICHAEL] Not necessarily. You can love a boss like you do a father.
[MICHAEL] Well, okay. Different management styles.
[MICHAEL] Who is this? How did you get this number?
[MICHAEL] Oh my God. Packer. Packster. Whacky Pack. How you doin'?
[MICHAEL] Uh... no. Did anybody see a package here today? No. How big was it?
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Did you see a big package? Where did you leave it?
[MICHAEL] Really? Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me? Oh!
[MICHAEL] That was Packer! Oh, you're... you are dead. You are dead, my friend! That is hilar... Oh, God! Of course it was you.
[MICHAEL] Oh.  Yeah, yeah! Oh my God. It was Packer!
[MICHAEL] Hey, what's going on?
[MICHAEL] Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
[MICHAEL] Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads...
[MICHAEL] No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby. But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
[MICHAEL] They did this up in Albany...
[MICHAEL] And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so...
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like...
[MICHAEL] Anybody want any coffee or...
[MICHAEL] That's what I'm talking about!
[MICHAEL] Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
[MICHAEL] Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
[MICHAEL] We have nowhere else Jan. This...
[MICHAEL] OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
[MICHAEL] You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
[MICHAEL] Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy...
[MICHAEL] Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
[MICHAEL] Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.
[MICHAEL] Guys! Want to start unloading the truck?
[MICHAEL] Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.
[MICHAEL] Stand clear.
[MICHAEL] I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
[MICHAEL] Oh, oh, oh! We'll get somebody to clean that up.
[MICHAEL] We ought to have this thing serviced.
[MICHAEL] No, why? Why would I... ? You could...
[MICHAEL] Stay or...
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
[MICHAEL] I... That was just...
[MICHAEL] I was breathing.
[MICHAEL] I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
[MICHAEL] OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
[MICHAEL] I feel you.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Ah, you do. So...
[MICHAEL] I know. God! What is that?
[MICHAEL] It blows. It blows, man. Gah...
[MICHAEL] No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
[MICHAEL] You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
[MICHAEL] Dockworker's?
[MICHAEL] Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
[MICHAEL] The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
[MICHAEL] Yeah-es.
[MICHAEL] This is important. Ladies, take a breather. Jan, I uh wanna... Can I help you? Um... I wanted to say that the guys downstairs are thinking about forming a union. And they have some good points...
[MICHAEL] Don't get hysterical.
[MICHAEL] Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
[MICHAEL] But we're bonding down there!
[MICHAEL] I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through...
[MICHAEL] We have a history...
[MICHAEL] ...between us.
[MICHAEL] I won't
[MICHAEL] I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
[MICHAEL] Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
[MICHAEL] I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some...
[MICHAEL] You did uh... okay.
[MICHAEL] Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
[MICHAEL] Nope. The opposite of that.
[MICHAEL] Ok, good.
[MICHAEL] I probably will, why do you ask?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Dude, I'm gonna nail it. Me in New York? Oh, I own that city. Fuggedaboudit! See ya!
[MICHAEL] Josh Porter, high five.  Bam.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, how ya doing? Nobody needs to introduce this guy. Craiggers.
[MICHAEL] You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
[MICHAEL] So what's going on? What I miss?
[MICHAEL] Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and...
[MICHAEL] Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
[MICHAEL] You know, months ago, just once, It's, just stupid. Just forget it,
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah.
[MICHAEL] Ditto.  How are you Jan?
[MICHAEL] What is a business? Is it a collection of numbers and sales reports? Sure. But as you know, David and Jan, it is much more.
[MICHAEL] Yes, thank you.
[MICHAEL] Yes, absolutely David. Get that for you. I umm...
[MICHAEL] No you're not.
[MICHAEL] Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
[MICHAEL] Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
[MICHAEL] I am serious. And don't call me Shirley. Airplane.
[MICHAEL] No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.
[MICHAEL] I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.
[MICHAEL] I know. It was borderline at best and... And Jan is a fantastic executive and has all the integrity in the world and um, I'm really sorry. It will never happen again.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day.
[MICHAEL] Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
[MICHAEL] Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
[MICHAEL] No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Heisman! Because I need to think. Okay, Jim? Oh, Kevin, oh!  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted.
[MICHAEL] Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] You all right Ryan?
[MICHAEL] Pam!
[MICHAEL] Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
[MICHAEL] Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
[MICHAEL] That would look terrible. These are mostly salesmen and salesmen expect to be entertained and you are the main act.
[MICHAEL] That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
[MICHAEL] But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
[MICHAEL] Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
[MICHAEL] Don't. Don't try and think of a question to humor me. Just... try not to be such an idiot.
[MICHAEL] Insult.
[MICHAEL] It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a s*x Ed class.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
[MICHAEL] I do. Both of them.
[MICHAEL] No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
[MICHAEL] Congratulations.
[MICHAEL] No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
[MICHAEL] He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
[MICHAEL] Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
[MICHAEL] Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
[MICHAEL] Well, it's mostly made up. So...
[MICHAEL] Dwight, they called your name.
[MICHAEL] All right. You know what? Okay. No. No problem. You are lucky you have me here. I'm going to cover for you.  All right!
[MICHAEL] I got thirsty. How'd it go?
[MICHAEL] You would not believe what happened here.
[MICHAEL] Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
[MICHAEL] She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
[MICHAEL] Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
[MICHAEL] ... Oh, God is that today?
[MICHAEL] They're cool.
[MICHAEL] Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City.
[MICHAEL] Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
[MICHAEL] I work with a bunch of nerds.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yes, hello, how are you? Good to see you. Wow, you've really grown up. You know what? Don't mind me saying so, she is turning into a stone cold fox. Better keep the... frat boys away from her.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Nice to meet you.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor.  But I'm sort of the conductor of the office here, right?  You want to try?
[MICHAEL] All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga!
[MICHAEL] Dwight! Dwight!
[MICHAEL] What the hell are you reading to them?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you.
[MICHAEL] What's a Nazi?
[MICHAEL] Don't!
[MICHAEL] Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it?
[MICHAEL] Why don't you just leave? Okay?
[MICHAEL] Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook?
[MICHAEL] No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it.
[MICHAEL] Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
[MICHAEL] I'm not just a middle... man...
[MICHAEL] You are describing Office Depot, and they're kind of running us out of business.
[MICHAEL] ...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
[MICHAEL] Say hi to the kids.
[MICHAEL] Yaaaaay.
[MICHAEL] What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem?
[MICHAEL] No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
[MICHAEL] It's true. I did.
[MICHAEL] I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
[MICHAEL] It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  Ryan, can you come here a second?  I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar.
[MICHAEL] I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine?
[MICHAEL] Oka--
[MICHAEL] Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
[MICHAEL] That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to...
[MICHAEL] Stop! Stop! Stop!  Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Uhh, I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Can everyone please shut up, please! So you don't miss it.
[MICHAEL] Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh.
[MICHAEL] Coulda sworn there was...
[MICHAEL] ...uh, no.
[MICHAEL] Uh, just never happened.
[MICHAEL] Uh, nope.
[MICHAEL] I do okay.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Okay! Alright, okay.
[MICHAEL] ...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.
[MICHAEL] Oh, that's okay, she can keep those.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] You have to ask me that because you work for human resources.
[MICHAEL] Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
[MICHAEL] What about...
[MICHAEL] ...Jan. Kay.
[MICHAEL] ...Or biologically.
[MICHAEL] Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
[MICHAEL] Oh... kay.
[MICHAEL] Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do.
[MICHAEL] One more time.  You...
[MICHAEL] Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves.
[MICHAEL] You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend.
[MICHAEL] Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
[MICHAEL] You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright.
[MICHAEL] Alright, let me explain. Again.  Phil has recruited me and another guy. Now, we are getting three people each. The more people that get involved, the more who are investing, the more money we're all going to make. It's not a pyramid scheme, it is a... it's not even a scheme per se, it's...  ... I have to go make a call.
[MICHAEL] Oh ho ho! What?
[MICHAEL] Thank you! That's really nice.
[MICHAEL] Ah, thank you sir.
[MICHAEL] Ohh, god.
[MICHAEL] No no no, no, new suit, please.
[MICHAEL] Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
[MICHAEL] Good luck. One of a kind.
[MICHAEL] Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it. They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
[MICHAEL] Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
[MICHAEL] Let's get the party started. Not the way I taught you!
[MICHAEL] Oh, great, put her through.
[MICHAEL] Hey, you.
[MICHAEL] It is urgent, I just wanted to call and wish you a happy birthday.
[MICHAEL] Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
[MICHAEL] Thanks.
[MICHAEL] Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart.
[MICHAEL] Thanks.
[MICHAEL] Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
[MICHAEL] You didn't know it was my birthday.
[MICHAEL] Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut .
[MICHAEL] Mmm.
[MICHAEL] Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great!  Thank you my friends, she is perfect! Ahhh, Dwight, may I have your chair please? And, um, some singles, if you will! Allllright. Nnnnn-dink!  Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright?
[MICHAEL] Okay. I'm so nervous.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
[MICHAEL] You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Ohhh, God.
[MICHAEL] Ohhh, no.
[MICHAEL] Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please.
[MICHAEL] Get in here... everybody.
[MICHAEL] Birthday party subs! My gift to you.
[MICHAEL] The best.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Well, then just have the tomato and ketchup. Still good.
[MICHAEL] Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
[MICHAEL] Mm-kay. Get whatever you want.  And choke on it.
[MICHAEL] Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
[MICHAEL] Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
[MICHAEL] Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm...
[MICHAEL] ... I asked for trick candles.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day.
[MICHAEL] ... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us .
[MICHAEL] There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
[MICHAEL] And laughter... also.
[MICHAEL] Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
[MICHAEL] Nyeh, I work here.  Alright, well, you know what, since Toby doesn't speak for everybody and I am your boss, I... think you should just go home. Take the rest of the afternoon off. Take a sick day.
[MICHAEL] Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
[MICHAEL] Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun.
[MICHAEL] How dare you sir. You are gross.
[MICHAEL] No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
[MICHAEL] Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
[MICHAEL] Kevin. You heard anything yet?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well. Live strong.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
[MICHAEL] Oh, these... all your kids?
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay?
[MICHAEL] Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
[MICHAEL] Oh... God...  God!  We're gonna beat this, okay? We're gonna... come here .
[MICHAEL] Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
[MICHAEL] Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Oh! You didn't need to do that. ...Nightswept. This is... really amazing. Thank you. I love it.
[MICHAEL] Ry, is he bugging you? Dwight, dude, you gotta take a chill pill, man. It was one joint in the parking lot. You know, you're totally harshing the office mellow.
[MICHAEL] Narc!
[MICHAEL] I wasn't attempting to compliment you.
[MICHAEL] Uuf, well...
[MICHAEL] Okay...
[MICHAEL] Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  Dude, where's my office?  I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest!
[MICHAEL] Thanks. M-m-munchies. Who wants some munchies?
[MICHAEL] Remember the narc bit?  Uh-oh, who's in trouble?
[MICHAEL] Waa... what? What are you talking about?
[MICHAEL] I can do that, it is my office.
[MICHAEL] No, uh, no. That was a test. I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him? How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs."
[MICHAEL] Are these facts scaring you, or are they not?
[MICHAEL] Do you think that smoking drugs is cool? Do you think that doing alcohol is cool?
[MICHAEL] Okay, enough, enough, enough! I have written down a list of illegal drugs. Take a gander. How many of these are you familiar with?
[MICHAEL] Yes it is.
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what, Toby? Pam, can you take this down?  In addition to Toby's urine being tested, I would like to test his blood and his hair.
[MICHAEL] I can test anyone randomly, and I have chosen you randomly.
[MICHAEL] Okay, eeny, meenie, miney, moe, is random. Okay, you know what? I'm going to need a volunteer to select one of these words and tell us of something tragic that happened in either their lives, or the lives of a loved one. Yeah, Pam.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Jim it's okay. You can t...  This would be a good place to let it out, Jim. These are people you can trust. These are people who care about you.  It's okay, just we will not judge you. We are here to not judge you.  Oh, he's doing it, okay.  It's okay.  Oh. Okay, are you sure?  That looked like it was going to be good. Alright.  Okay, well.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I will not be.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well Dwight just know that I've been very busy today and I got a lot of work to do and I wasn't planning on going to the bathroom and I don't even know if anything is going to come out, okay? So good. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Just forget it. Just the urine.
[MICHAEL] Just. I need your urine.
[MICHAEL] Yes in a cup, we're not animals, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] It's none of your business.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Alright. Just, I went to an Alicia Keys concert, over the weekend, and I think I may have gotten high accidentally by a girl with a lip ring.
[MICHAEL] I need clean urine for the lady.
[MICHAEL] Don't think of it that way. It's like, urine goes all over the place. You know, there's no controlling it. It just... goes
[MICHAEL] A cup could find its way under the urine. It might be an accident. It happens.
[MICHAEL] No, just look. Look. Just... just fill up the cup.
[MICHAEL] What's wrong? Where's your costume?
[MICHAEL] Why? Wha...
[MICHAEL] Yes, sir.
[MICHAEL] So you wanna? Thanks.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Good.
[MICHAEL] No. Oh. Uh...
[MICHAEL] Alright.  Well, Thank you.
[MICHAEL] That is... who makes that?
[MICHAEL] Do you mind if I wear that for the photo?
[MICHAEL] What's the dealio?
[MICHAEL] What's the problem?
[MICHAEL] So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So...
[MICHAEL] Okay... what?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
[MICHAEL] No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
[MICHAEL] Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
[MICHAEL] Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
[MICHAEL] Come on, seriously, that?
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop! Let's see if we can just brainstorm and find some creative alternatives that are win/win.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.
[MICHAEL] Okay... well, brainstorm. Own the solution.
[MICHAEL] Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
[MICHAEL] It is done!
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Are those all the other complains?
[MICHAEL] I would like to see those please.
[MICHAEL] You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
[MICHAEL] Okay.  There! No more conflict.  I had to use win/lose on that. It was not pretty.  All right... is that it?
[MICHAEL] You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
[MICHAEL] That's what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
[MICHAEL] Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
[MICHAEL] All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
[MICHAEL] Uh... "Does she have to plan her wedding on office time? Couldn't she do that at home?"  Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
[MICHAEL] Makin' progress.  Yes?
[MICHAEL] What?!
[MICHAEL] You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
[MICHAEL] Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
[MICHAEL] And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
[MICHAEL] Oh... ok.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well... all settled, then.
[MICHAEL] Uh. Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Okay! Calm down.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey!
[MICHAEL] Stop.
[MICHAEL] Okay...
[MICHAEL] Dwight...
[MICHAEL] Stop...
[MICHAEL] Oh... kay...
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
[MICHAEL] Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
[MICHAEL] Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
[MICHAEL] Good. Okay.
[MICHAEL] Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
[MICHAEL] It'll take like two seconds.
[MICHAEL] Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.
[MICHAEL] Come on, everybody.
[MICHAEL] We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
[MICHAEL] Good, let's check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] You just press the button.
[MICHAEL] Okay, good. Check that out.
[MICHAEL] That's terrible.
[MICHAEL] Let's pay Mr. Price Gouger.  Okay... we can do this. Come on, everybody. All right. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Top 80 percent!
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
[MICHAEL] Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here.
[MICHAEL] I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
[MICHAEL] Oh, come on. Come on.
[MICHAEL] You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
[MICHAEL] Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
[MICHAEL] Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
[MICHAEL] So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
[MICHAEL] Comedy is very much alive, as are homeless people.
[MICHAEL] Well, then, they need our money more than ever.
[MICHAEL] Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS.
[MICHAEL] No, I mean Afghanistanis with AIDS.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] That's a dog.
[MICHAEL] That's a shawl.
[MICHAEL] No. Humans with AIDS.
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
[MICHAEL] It's Casino Night like Las Vegas. There are fire-eaters all over the place.
[MICHAEL] Well, actually, it's my warehouse.
[MICHAEL] Why are you here?
[MICHAEL] Not. I said, not that.
[MICHAEL] That's ironic.
[MICHAEL] That you are afraid.
[MICHAEL] Dinkin' flicka.
[MICHAEL] Who?
[MICHAEL] Do I know a Carol Stills?
[MICHAEL] Hi, Carol. How you doing?
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
[MICHAEL] Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped.
[MICHAEL] Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you...
[MICHAEL] Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
[MICHAEL] Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?
[MICHAEL] Hey, Jan. How you doing?
[MICHAEL] I am?
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay.
[MICHAEL] AIDS.
[MICHAEL] Okay, sounds great.
[MICHAEL] Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
[MICHAEL] Right.
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Problem. Good.
[MICHAEL] Good, All right. Sounds great.
[MICHAEL] Bye.
[MICHAEL] Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Carol.
[MICHAEL] You look great.
[MICHAEL] Oh, well... Kiss.  That's how we do it in the paper biz. It's European and... Yes? Ah, Dwight
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Billy, your nurse is hot.
[MICHAEL] Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
[MICHAEL] Chili's is great.
[MICHAEL] Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled! Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
[MICHAEL] All-in.
[MICHAEL] What are... That's insane.
[MICHAEL] Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
[MICHAEL] Okay, all right, whatever.
[MICHAEL] You really screwed that up.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[MICHAEL] Jan.
[MICHAEL] Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
[MICHAEL] After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
[MICHAEL] Um...
[MICHAEL] Hey. What...
[MICHAEL] Four!  Blow. Blow for luck! Yeah! Also, you. Not playing favorites.  All right, here we go!
[MICHAEL] Yeah!
[MICHAEL] So close. So close.
[MICHAEL] Hey, okay.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Thanks for coming.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Talk to you Monday.
[MICHAEL] Good night. She's a good boss.
[MICHAEL] Oh, she's great.
[MICHAEL] That's what faggie means!
[MICHAEL] It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
[MICHAEL] Exactly!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I know.
[MICHAEL] OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
[MICHAEL] No. No it's not. I feel terrible about it. I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake. If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know? I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing. Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime. And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
[MICHAEL] What about Oscar?
[MICHAEL] There could be others... I need to know. I don't want to offend anybody else.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
[MICHAEL] I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
[MICHAEL] That's ridiculous.
[MICHAEL] Let's call him and get the website.
[MICHAEL] I watch the L Word. I watch, Queer as F***, so...
[MICHAEL] What? What does that even...
[MICHAEL] Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade? It's not like gay... shame festival.
[MICHAEL] I think Angela might be gay. Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair? Maybe! Is that what this is about?
[MICHAEL] I don't kn--
[MICHAEL] Anything's possible.
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
[MICHAEL] Trick question! Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know. Is that the right answer?
[MICHAEL] Yes, that's a good point. She has a good point. Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law. I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them. So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey s*x as much as they could. You know? Sounds pretty good, right?
[MICHAEL] That's great. Congratulations Phyllis. That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!  See? Everybody has a chance!
[MICHAEL] Right!  And I take that as a compliment.
[MICHAEL] Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
[MICHAEL] No, I am just coming out myself. I am coming out hetero!
[MICHAEL] You misunderstand-- OK. You know what, OK. I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is. You ready? I am going to embrace Oscar. You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything. Here we go. We are going to make a statement. You and I are going to make a statement together. Oscar is my friend ---
[MICHAEL] ...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!
[MICHAEL] All right, um... sorry.
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry I called you faggie. You're not faggie. You're a a good guy.
[MICHAEL] Did you see Oprah yesterday?
[MICHAEL] I, uh... I am going to be a father.
[MICHAEL] Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Just do it, okay?
[MICHAEL] Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
[MICHAEL] Eight months?
[MICHAEL] I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
[MICHAEL] You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby...
[MICHAEL] Twenty years.
[MICHAEL] Thirty.
[MICHAEL] It's a deal.
[MICHAEL] Yesh.
[MICHAEL] Right there. Ah.
[MICHAEL] Per diem.
[MICHAEL] Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, do it!
[MICHAEL] Really? Okay. Well, word of advice: unbutton that top button. Let those things breathe. Any message you want me to relate to Jim?
[MICHAEL] Um. Okay, um.
[MICHAEL] You got that?
[MICHAEL] Write it down.
[MICHAEL] Um.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
[MICHAEL] Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
[MICHAEL] Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
[MICHAEL] Hey!
[MICHAEL] Ah.
[MICHAEL] Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
[MICHAEL] The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
[MICHAEL] Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
[MICHAEL] That is crooked on that side.
[MICHAEL] Hey hey!
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.
[MICHAEL] Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
[MICHAEL] Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
[MICHAEL] All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
[MICHAEL] Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.
[MICHAEL] You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.
[MICHAEL] Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?
[MICHAEL] So maybe. See ya.
[MICHAEL] Because he's afraid to fly.
[MICHAEL] Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
[MICHAEL] Yep. Yeah, she's up front.
[MICHAEL] I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
[MICHAEL] See you in a bit. Bye-bye.  May I have a moment of your time please?
[MICHAEL] I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
[MICHAEL] And?
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
[MICHAEL] I will call him later with that message.
[MICHAEL] Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
[MICHAEL] Opportunity, promotion, blah, blah. You know, Jim, those are just words. Have you taken into account other factors, vis-a-vis bosses? Is Josh funnier than I am? Does he even have a girlfriend? Because I have two, basically.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
[MICHAEL] I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
[MICHAEL] The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
[MICHAEL] Any messages for 308? All right.
[MICHAEL] What's up?
[MICHAEL] Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
[MICHAEL] Okay! Excellent. Oh...
[MICHAEL] Shut it.  Hey, Pam, what's up? Yep, yech... no. Tell him I will give him general specifics tomorrow, okay? Yes.  Say hi to Pam!
[MICHAEL] Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Pam says hi.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
[MICHAEL] Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
[MICHAEL] Well, let's...
[MICHAEL] Come on!
[MICHAEL] Come on!
[MICHAEL] Fine.
[MICHAEL] Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
[MICHAEL] Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
[MICHAEL] Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
[MICHAEL] This is the party.
[MICHAEL] Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right.
[MICHAEL] People have been filtering in and out.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Sure. You like Cosmos?
[MICHAEL] Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
[MICHAEL] I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just...
[MICHAEL] I'm not better than Josh.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
[MICHAEL] Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
[MICHAEL] Evan, this is Jim.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
[MICHAEL] Best friends.
[MICHAEL] Whoa. What are those stains?
[MICHAEL] Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
[MICHAEL] Alright, everybody here? Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes pleeeeease! Thank yooouuu!
[MICHAEL] Don't whine. Get the window.
[MICHAEL] People work faster after...
[MICHAEL] No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Ouchy.
[MICHAEL] Three hours, wow. Have fun.
[MICHAEL] Hi.
[MICHAEL] Oh. That's nice.
[MICHAEL] ...what?
[MICHAEL] ...you were at the dentist?
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Do you want an M&M?
[MICHAEL] No seriously. You should have an M&M, they're really good.
[MICHAEL] They're good, huh?
[MICHAEL] Hey. I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
[MICHAEL] Sounds like a good dentist.
[MICHAEL] What's his name?
[MICHAEL] Your dentist's name is Crentist.
[MICHAEL] Huh. Sounds a lot like dentist.
[MICHAEL] You should... floss.
[MICHAEL] Well then... I am glad you're ok.
[MICHAEL] Ohhhh. Arrrgggh!
[MICHAEL] Well, I just got off the phone with Jan. And um... she demoted me.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!
[MICHAEL] And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
[MICHAEL] I know. I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me. You've been my most trusted ally.
[MICHAEL] Yep, I did. I did. But I think... you should do it.
[MICHAEL] Perfect, well, we're settled.
[MICHAEL] All right. Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
[MICHAEL] Ohh..
[MICHAEL] Can't you? That's so nice.
[MICHAEL] You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
[MICHAEL] Because, Dwight... never lies.
[MICHAEL] Because that's all it takes.
[MICHAEL] Oh, I'll be fine.
[MICHAEL] No, no, I don't, but---
[MICHAEL] I... won't. I won't.
[MICHAEL] It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] But you said you liked it. You've always admired it.
[MICHAEL] Take it back.
[MICHAEL] That's my car.
[MICHAEL] THAT'S MY CAR.
[MICHAEL] Jan called me about your little meeting!
[MICHAEL] I know, what you did. I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Oh do you? Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?! How dare you, Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
[MICHAEL] Not. Good. Enough!
[MICHAEL] I have a laundry machine!
[MICHAEL] I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
[MICHAEL] You can get up. Get up.  And you can hug it out, bitch.
[MICHAEL] Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.
[MICHAEL] All right, I'll be right back.
[MICHAEL] There you go.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] Don't mind if I do. See you in a minute.
[MICHAEL] There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
[MICHAEL] There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
[MICHAEL] All right. Okay.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Oookay. Let me see if I have his cell. Is this the only reason you are calling, Jan? Or does somebody miss me?
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I am. It's very sad. Because he was my boss.
[MICHAEL] That's right, you worked with him. So did Creed. Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by. Cheer me up.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really? It's... pssssh... . He was almost 70. Circle of life.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Mmmmmm.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Must really have you thinkin'.
[MICHAEL] The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die. You knew that.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oh my God.
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck. And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him. And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
[MICHAEL] You really don't get it, do you? You don't understand these people. That is the last thing that they would want is a day off.
[MICHAEL] A statue.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him.
[MICHAEL] We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move...
[MICHAEL] I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
[MICHAEL] Life-size.
[MICHAEL] Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
[MICHAEL] Mm hm.
[MICHAEL] Oh do you? You know who wished they could get back to work is Ed Truck.
[MICHAEL] But Ed truck can't because he is---
[MICHAEL] DEAD.
[MICHAEL] That's perfect.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Well, you know what? I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it. He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham! His cappa is detated from his head!
[MICHAEL] Well, you know what? There's something wrong with you. There is something wrong with everybody in here. Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
[MICHAEL] Okay, fine. Hurry back.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Pam, you're a member of this family. So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
[MICHAEL] Okay, why don't you throw the ball to somebody else.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yes Stanley. Come on. Your turn, you have to go.
[MICHAEL] Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
[MICHAEL] Wow. If you wanna cry, that's okay.
[MICHAEL] Do you want to talk about it anymore?
[MICHAEL] Wait a second. That's Weekend at Bernie's.  Do you think that this is a game?
[MICHAEL] All right, we're starting over.
[MICHAEL] You are not leaving. No! We are not done.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Well, you know what? The guy who had my job has died. And nobody cares! And he sat at my desk.
[MICHAEL] How do you know?
[MICHAEL] That that bird was dead? Did you check its breathing?
[MICHAEL] Was its heart beating, Toby? Did you check it? No, of course you didn't. You're not a veterinarian. You don't know ANYTHING!
[MICHAEL] Oh, God!
[MICHAEL] Oh my God! Oh my God, come on ...
[MICHAEL] Oh shhhh--oot!
[MICHAEL] No, he's not.
[MICHAEL] No, he's not.
[MICHAEL] Well, you can't get diseases from a bird!
[MICHAEL] We don't know if it's dead.
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith. But that is what you do when things die. You honor them. Toby killed this bird. And now we are going to honor it.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no! That's enough! You know what? This bird is dead. He died alone. The least you can do is be there for him now.  Find a box for him.
[MICHAEL] What are... What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] No, God, no it's not! What is the matter with you? Is that the beak!?
[MICHAEL] Dwight, do you have the box?
[MICHAEL] You made this? Wow.  That's... that's very nice.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Shhh.
[MICHAEL] Uhhh... nothing.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
[MICHAEL] Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
[MICHAEL] I worked. And then I went home to my condo. And Carol came over. And then we had s*x. Is that what you want to hear?
[MICHAEL] Uh huh.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
[MICHAEL] No, I think you're cutting in line.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm not going to settle down.
[MICHAEL] Get in the back please.
[MICHAEL] Boooooo. Thank you. . That's right.
[MICHAEL] No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind.
[MICHAEL] I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
[MICHAEL] Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown.
[MICHAEL] Pam, productivity starts with patience and determination. I'll be back.
[MICHAEL] Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.
[MICHAEL] Thank God.
[MICHAEL] Is there anyway that you could do all, all of them?
[MICHAEL] All right! Thank you!
[MICHAEL] Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
[MICHAEL] Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you.
[MICHAEL] And I will be taking questions.
[MICHAEL] Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
[MICHAEL] Hey, what time is it?
[MICHAEL] AM or PM?
[MICHAEL] Oh, good.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Koselli. With the Jello.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Right. Good.
[MICHAEL] Goodnight!
[MICHAEL] Nice dress, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] How come you didn't get me one?
[MICHAEL] Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
[MICHAEL] Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
[MICHAEL] Kelly?
[MICHAEL] Um... why don't you tell us a little bit about the origins of the holiday.
[MICHAEL] All right, all right, all right, all right. This isn't 'Lord of the Rings'.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Spoiler... alert.
[MICHAEL] Just stop it.  What's the... oh, whoa!  Where did that come from?
[MICHAEL] Thank you, Kevin.
[MICHAEL] Well, I find it beautiful.
[MICHAEL] No...
[MICHAEL] No, You're not going to collect them.
[MICHAEL] No. This is delightful, charming culture.
[MICHAEL] What does that look like to you?
[MICHAEL] No one's even going to notice.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
[MICHAEL] No. These s'mores are disgusting.
[MICHAEL] Do you think they have any s'mores?
[MICHAEL] Wow.
[MICHAEL] Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!
[MICHAEL] She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
[MICHAEL] I'm going to be.  Hi, I'm just going to get this for a sec... just a sec.  Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband.
[MICHAEL] What do you say?
[MICHAEL] I didn't hear you.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Okay. Good night.  Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.
[MICHAEL] All right. Good night.
[MICHAEL] That's so spicy.
[MICHAEL] Oh. You waiting for a call?
[MICHAEL] Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
[MICHAEL] I was in that marriage arena, though.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
[MICHAEL] We're so alike. So alike.
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] I'm... what? I didn't
[MICHAEL] Can I have a ride home?
[MICHAEL] Sorry.
[MICHAEL] ...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
[MICHAEL] Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] I don't understand.
[MICHAEL] On whom's authority?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
[MICHAEL] Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
[MICHAEL] Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
[MICHAEL] Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
[MICHAEL] Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
[MICHAEL] Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
[MICHAEL] Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make? We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Do I have any messages?
[MICHAEL] Ok, ok...
[MICHAEL] You knew about this all along, didn't you?
[MICHAEL] Traitor. You are a traitor.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
[MICHAEL] Darryl. Noble Darryl.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
[MICHAEL] So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
[MICHAEL] Awesome.
[MICHAEL] Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
[MICHAEL] Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
[MICHAEL] No... way.
[MICHAEL] No. There's no one else.
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. Um...
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] You sent him cards? You never met him.
[MICHAEL] I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Can you tell us why you are shutting down Scranton and putting 15 people out of work?
[MICHAEL] Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
[MICHAEL] Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
[MICHAEL] Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
[MICHAEL] Don't touch me this time.
[MICHAEL] Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
[MICHAEL] The office.
[MICHAEL] No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
[MICHAEL] What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
[MICHAEL] All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
[MICHAEL] That was hilarious. The foam ...
[MICHAEL] Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one.
[MICHAEL] God, Dwight!
[MICHAEL] What?!
[MICHAEL] We did it? We did it.
[MICHAEL] Right here! Right here!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, baby!
[MICHAEL] We did it!
[MICHAEL] How did we do it?
[MICHAEL] I don't understand.
[MICHAEL] Yes, please.
[MICHAEL] Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Andy Bernard.
[MICHAEL] Saint Bernard.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] I'm not...
[MICHAEL] I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
[MICHAEL] Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
[MICHAEL] Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
[MICHAEL] Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
[MICHAEL] Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay.
[MICHAEL] Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
[MICHAEL] Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
[MICHAEL] Welcome.
[MICHAEL] Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
[MICHAEL] Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
[MICHAEL] Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
[MICHAEL] A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.
[MICHAEL] No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
[MICHAEL] How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
[MICHAEL] Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is...
[MICHAEL] Right.
[MICHAEL] Not now.
[MICHAEL] I told you the titles are irrelevant. They just relate to pay scale.
[MICHAEL] It is not a matter of more or less. Your pay is just different. Okay? All right! Show time, part one.
[MICHAEL] I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
[MICHAEL] Work it out amongst your selves!
[MICHAEL] Please! I have a company to run. Well, you let me run the company?
[MICHAEL] Will you?
[MICHAEL] Please?
[MICHAEL] Nope, no. Guests only.
[MICHAEL] Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo.
[MICHAEL] Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
[MICHAEL] No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself.
[MICHAEL] Wrong. Toby, this is an orientation not a borientation. Okay. Do not worry. All of your questions are about to be answered. Cell phones and pagers off, please.
[MICHAEL] Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
[MICHAEL] So check out how we live
[MICHAEL] They call it Scranton.
[MICHAEL] The Electric City. Scranton.
[MICHAEL] The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
[MICHAEL] Oh-kay. Sorry to interrupt. I...
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] What is that? A squid's eye or...
[MICHAEL] How did you...
[MICHAEL] Ssshh stupid! Um...
[MICHAEL] Yes, yes! Okay!
[MICHAEL] Okay, here we go.
[MICHAEL] Oh!
[MICHAEL] Oh! Oh! Oh!
[MICHAEL] Scuse me! Scuse me!
[MICHAEL] You me? You me? Me you? You! You! You me! Bow Bow Bow!
[MICHAEL] You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
[MICHAEL] Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
[MICHAEL] Okay! Okay!
[MICHAEL] All right, all right, I'm on a roll.
[MICHAEL] Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would.
[MICHAEL] I understand. We're all friends.
[MICHAEL] Oh, well. Just use the momentum of your lower half to hoist yourself up.
[MICHAEL] Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
[MICHAEL] Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
[MICHAEL] Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
[MICHAEL] We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
[MICHAEL] I'm right in your crack!
[MICHAEL] Up and over.
[MICHAEL] Up and over.
[MICHAEL] You've got it.
[MICHAEL] You've got it, you've got it.
[MICHAEL] Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
[MICHAEL] Easy.
[MICHAEL] Don't...
[MICHAEL] What...
[MICHAEL] I don't understand.
[MICHAEL] Well, we'll squeeze you in.
[MICHAEL] My management style? So... didn't you think 'Lazy Scranton' was funny?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
[MICHAEL] You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
[MICHAEL] Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
[MICHAEL] Probably the best advice you ever gave me, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Whoa, Angela! Hold on. Hooters is a restaurant. With over 400 locations worldwide.
[MICHAEL] No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
[MICHAEL] Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Go home, Toby. Just...
[MICHAEL] Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful.  "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
[MICHAEL] No. No, no, no. No. You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh...
[MICHAEL] THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
[MICHAEL] Hi, Jan!
[MICHAEL] I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Yes, I know that. For, I do read the memos.
[MICHAEL] Uh... that I have not decided yet.
[MICHAEL] Thank you, Andy. That's... very kind. Thanks.
[MICHAEL] Shut it...
[MICHAEL] Shut it! That's...  suck up!
[MICHAEL] Ohhh, wow. Look at that. How cute.
[MICHAEL] Ohh. May I?
[MICHAEL] Hey, look at me, I'm a baby! I'm one of those babies from "Look Who's Talking." What am I thinking?  Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
[MICHAEL] I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding.
[MICHAEL] Hey Jan, speaking of Stamford, Hannah brought in her baby.
[MICHAEL] Hannah?
[MICHAEL] Kuhhhh... you are such a racist.
[MICHAEL] Because you think he's black.
[MICHAEL] Stop it. Stop it right-stop it right now.
[MICHAEL] In our society, a black man can be arrested for almost anything. He was probably at a sporting event and... saw some people pushing each other, and he intervened.
[MICHAEL] Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
[MICHAEL] Good. All right.
[MICHAEL] Okay, are you cool, really?
[MICHAEL] Um... Martin, from Stamford, was, at one time, in prison.  No. Dwight! Be cool! Be cool!
[MICHAEL] Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
[MICHAEL] ...Danny Glover.  Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Who?
[MICHAEL] Oh. Please. Colin Powell.
[MICHAEL] Yup.
[MICHAEL] Apollo Creed.
[MICHAEL] No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them.
[MICHAEL] That is awesome.
[MICHAEL] Well, we are running a business, so.
[MICHAEL] Ah. Well. That's not true.
[MICHAEL] No you would not.
[MICHAEL] Why don't we... pump some iron? Anyone wanna... pump up?
[MICHAEL] It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
[MICHAEL] Ah. A ten inch black and white?
[MICHAEL] Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  All right, hey, hey, hey, hey, that's just the way we talk in the clink. Been a lot of fun talk about prison today, but I am here to scare you straight. I AM HERE TO SCARE YOU STRAIIIGHT!! In prison you are somebody's bitch. Oh, and you.  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!
[MICHAEL] Internet.
[MICHAEL] And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office.
[MICHAEL] I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
[MICHAEL] And I nevah got caught, neither.
[MICHAEL] Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
[MICHAEL] The worst thing about prison was the... was the Dementors. They... were flying all over the place, and they were scary. And they'd come down, and they'd suck the soul out of your body, and it hurt!
[MICHAEL] No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay, fine. You guys think prison is so great? All right. Well, here you go.
[MICHAEL] No! If you think is prison is so wonderful, then, enjoy prison! They are such babies. I am going to leave them in there until they can appreciate what it's like to have freedom. And if this doesn't bother them, then I am out of ideas.
[MICHAEL] They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
[MICHAEL] Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
[MICHAEL] Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
[MICHAEL] I'm looking for the toy drive box.
[MICHAEL] OK... Well, I need to put this bike in there. I hope it'll fit, with all these little knickknacks.
[MICHAEL] Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
[MICHAEL] Well, that is probably from the test drive.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Oh, thanks.
[MICHAEL] Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that.
[MICHAEL] OK. Did everybody get one of these?
[MICHAEL] Terrific. Good.
[MICHAEL] There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  You're about five hours early to the party. You're such a blonde.
[MICHAEL] Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side.
[MICHAEL] Turn around, turn around. Come on.
[MICHAEL] No, you get outta here.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.
[MICHAEL] That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] Right.
[MICHAEL] Yes, but what you didn't realize at the time was that I was with you in a sense. I was in your heart...
[MICHAEL] And next to your kids. What?
[MICHAEL] I don't understand?
[MICHAEL] OK
[MICHAEL] No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaica's largest fresh water pool.
[MICHAEL] I got us tickets to Sandals, Jamaica, We leave day after tomorrow. . You better find the skimpiest bikini there is.
[MICHAEL] And it's all inclusive.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over.
[MICHAEL] Keep it up Stanley and you will lose New Year's.
[MICHAEL] Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.
[MICHAEL] Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances.
[MICHAEL] Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests.
[MICHAEL] Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
[MICHAEL] It hurts my heart. It hurts my stomach. It hurts my arms.
[MICHAEL] Thanks. How did you push away the bad thoughts?
[MICHAEL] Like maybe, the real reason they left was because there were things they wanted you to do in bed, that were, foreign, and scary?
[MICHAEL] And not that you didn't want to try them. Some wine may have helped. Do you know what I'm referring to?
[MICHAEL] Take it from Toby.
[MICHAEL] Hey, would you like to go to Sandals, Jamaica with me?
[MICHAEL] It's all...  OK.
[MICHAEL] Carol?
[MICHAEL] I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it.
[MICHAEL] Goodbye my lover. Goodbye my friend.
[MICHAEL] All right. Nothing here to distract myself with anyway.
[MICHAEL] Hooters?
[MICHAEL] Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters.
[MICHAEL] Why not?
[MICHAEL] Ok, feel better.
[MICHAEL] C'mon Jim, let's go.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy.
[MICHAEL] Carol used to drink lattes.
[MICHAEL] She would get this little foam mustache...
[MICHAEL] And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny.
[MICHAEL] She totally got me. She understood that we didn't have to laugh to enjoy ---
[MICHAEL] I'm just gonna call her.
[MICHAEL] Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.
[MICHAEL] You're right. That's good.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party.
[MICHAEL] Excuse me  Ah, un guard.  Family style.
[MICHAEL] I don't think... I love it!
[MICHAEL] I don't know what he's doing.
[MICHAEL] You know what we should do?
[MICHAEL] We should invite them to the Christmas party.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you are such mench my friend.
[MICHAEL] Nah, you rock. Tell you what, if you want it, it's yours.
[MICHAEL] Oh.  That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
[MICHAEL] Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room.
[MICHAEL] Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
[MICHAEL] We're going to ...
[MICHAEL] Do you agree about what?  Wow. You're lucky you're so darn cute.
[MICHAEL] What're you talking about?
[MICHAEL] When you know, you just know.
[MICHAEL] Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
[MICHAEL] It's... it's one of those two.
[MICHAEL] Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
[MICHAEL] Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile
[MICHAEL] Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, you. How are ya?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. Hey, you should stay because we are having fun and...
[MICHAEL] Where do you wanna go?
[MICHAEL] I... you know what? I, OK, listen. I like you. I really like you. So much in fact, that I would like you to accompany me on a trip to Sandals, Jamaica.
[MICHAEL] You want help? OK... Merry Christmas.
[MICHAEL] How can you be sure?
[MICHAEL] Don't make fun... You're making fun of me.
[MICHAEL] I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm.
[MICHAEL] I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
[MICHAEL] Oh, why do I feel like crap?
[MICHAEL] I had rebound? Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Relax.
[MICHAEL] Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later.
[MICHAEL] Aren't you going to ask me how Jamaica was? Say it. Ask me.
[MICHAEL] Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
[MICHAEL] OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
[MICHAEL] Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna...
[MICHAEL] You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
[MICHAEL] You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
[MICHAEL] Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time.
[MICHAEL] Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
[MICHAEL] Inventory's at the end of December.
[MICHAEL] I specifically went on vacation so I would miss it.
[MICHAEL] The Jamaicans don't have a word for "impossible."
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, that sounds amazing. You know what? The lady Jan Levinson wanted to go to Montego Bay.
[MICHAEL] Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim.
[MICHAEL] Oh no?
[MICHAEL] OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
[MICHAEL] Check it again. Hit refresh.
[MICHAEL] OK, Hey, man, how's it going?
[MICHAEL] That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
[MICHAEL] OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people?
[MICHAEL] OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it.
[MICHAEL] And you sent that out to everyone?
[MICHAEL] A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."
[MICHAEL] Not important.
[MICHAEL] OK, forget it.
[MICHAEL] Not now, not ever.
[MICHAEL] Aww, none of your business.
[MICHAEL] That photo is my personal property and if you are telling me you went on my computer and stole that photo, then I am going to call the cops.
[MICHAEL] This is probably the icebreaker you need.
[MICHAEL] I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. I am not dating Jan. She was very clear about that. Just two like souls having a romantic time in the most romantic place on earth. Got enough, weirdo?
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
[MICHAEL] She bought it?  OK. OK.
[MICHAEL] There an accident? Somebody hurt?
[MICHAEL] Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe...
[MICHAEL] My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Island living. You know?
[MICHAEL] Did she say what it's about?
[MICHAEL] There are copies in the bathroom?
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Guh.
[MICHAEL] OK, yup.
[MICHAEL] I...
[MICHAEL] I... I... Yes.
[MICHAEL] OK, yeah.
[MICHAEL] Who is Dr. Perry? I...
[MICHAEL] And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well.
[MICHAEL] So, umm... thanks for coming by. So, I, uh...
[MICHAEL] Well thanks for coming over, I appreciate -
[MICHAEL] Jan, you... complete... me.
[MICHAEL] Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.
[MICHAEL] You know what? Get Pam.
[MICHAEL] Pam.
[MICHAEL] Oh, that is gross.
[MICHAEL] Damn it.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you.
[MICHAEL] Well, thank you sir. Ok, now going by seniority. Phyllis, our resident senior.
[MICHAEL] Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
[MICHAEL] You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
[MICHAEL] Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Here ya go.
[MICHAEL] Please.
[MICHAEL] Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race."  And you guys are the retired marines.  And you guys are the mother and daughter.  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
[MICHAEL] No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back.
[MICHAEL] Just bragging rights.
[MICHAEL] It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
[MICHAEL] Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
[MICHAEL] Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment.
[MICHAEL] Hawkman.
[MICHAEL] Let's go. The men's room was disgusting.
[MICHAEL] You know, I used to go up there all the time with my step-dad, and I never caught anything that big.
[MICHAEL] You know what? Let's get right down to it. Dunder-Mifflin may be just two rooms and a warehouse, but what we lack in flash, we will make up for with hardwork and decency.
[MICHAEL] I think what Andy is trying to express is that while we have the resources of a large company, we will give you the care and attention of a small company.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Stop it.  Stop it.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Ah, no. Don't worry about it.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
[MICHAEL] Yes, Andy.
[MICHAEL] He didn't say.
[MICHAEL] No, you are remembering it wrong.
[MICHAEL] I knew it.
[MICHAEL] Where were you this morning?
[MICHAEL] Why do you lie, liar?
[MICHAEL] You are lying right now.
[MICHAEL] I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing.
[MICHAEL] Ok, you know what? I want you to think about your future in this company. I want you to think about it long and hard.
[MICHAEL] Don't. Don't you dare. I want to know what you were doing this morning by the end of the day.
[MICHAEL] Good luck.
[MICHAEL] Yes, well. It is a big loss. Dwight was the top salesman...
[MICHAEL] I said 'was'.
[MICHAEL] What does that even mean? That is impossible.
[MICHAEL] But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
[MICHAEL] Hey, what's up.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. Maybe.
[MICHAEL] Bathroom.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
[MICHAEL] Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, do you?
[MICHAEL] What did I say?
[MICHAEL] Huh.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no.
[MICHAEL] No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
[MICHAEL] Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
[MICHAEL] Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
[MICHAEL] Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
[MICHAEL] Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
[MICHAEL] Um.
[MICHAEL] No. I don't want to do any of that.
[MICHAEL] No, just stop. Stop. Stop doing it. You're going to drive me crazy.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] What's up?
[MICHAEL] Um. It takes a big man to admit his mistake. And I am that big man. Angela from accounting told me what you did.
[MICHAEL] Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
[MICHAEL] How's this place treating you?
[MICHAEL] Oh, well.
[MICHAEL] No. I'm sure.
[MICHAEL] So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please.
[MICHAEL] We can talk about that.  All right.
[MICHAEL] Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
[MICHAEL] Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?
[MICHAEL] Guilty.
[MICHAEL] Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.
[MICHAEL] How, would you stop interrupting please?
[MICHAEL] We will demonstrate on Pam.
[MICHAEL] Come on.
[MICHAEL] Well you get the picture. Thanks Pam.
[MICHAEL] He's not going to be a murderer.
[MICHAEL] You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
[MICHAEL] Okay. From the top. Ready? Three-
[MICHAEL] No problem. The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse. From 2:30 to 3:15. It is the only time that Bob was available. Sort of a guy's night out. A G-N-O if you will. A Gah-No. Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in. A G-A-I. A gay. Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys. A guy shower. An hour long shower with guys.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Yes! Oh! There-oh!
[MICHAEL] Oh God-
[MICHAEL] No, no, no!
[MICHAEL] You should get out of them.
[MICHAEL] I did not order a stripper.
[MICHAEL] Um, not personally, no.
[MICHAEL] I can't get a stripper here. Sexual Harassment.
[MICHAEL] So that's what that means.
[MICHAEL] Gay.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Co-ed naked strippers in this office. For realsies.
[MICHAEL] Well get on it. And make it happen.
[MICHAEL] Gotcha, oh!  Yes?
[MICHAEL] I'm in the, I'm in the s*x shop.
[MICHAEL] Squarepants?
[MICHAEL] And you think that'd be sexy?
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Hello!
[MICHAEL] You wearing a thong?
[MICHAEL] Hello ladies. Who here is a history buff? Who's a fan of buff naked? Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.
[MICHAEL] Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?
[MICHAEL] He's in his knickers. Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.
[MICHAEL] Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.
[MICHAEL] And when they came over on the Mayflower. Bow chicka bow.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them. Especially that one.
[MICHAEL] No. Yes.
[MICHAEL] But I got all the foot off of it.
[MICHAEL] Well then my man meat, he shall have. There you go. Deliciousity.
[MICHAEL] I call shuffle. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here. Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
[MICHAEL] Nice outfit.
[MICHAEL] He's right there. There he is.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Alright, I'll do it. Yeah. Lets do it. Lets do this thing. Yeah. What do I?
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Here we go. Alright!
[MICHAEL] Not bad! Not bad! You smell nice. Like Tide.
[MICHAEL] You smell like Tide detergent. Do you use Tide detergent? Ha ha ha! I have a girlfriend so...
[MICHAEL] Yeah she probably, yeah she would be. You know what, okay, excuse me. Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music. This is wrong, this is wrong! This is wrong! I have a girlfriend. And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay. Shame on you. Go back to work!
[MICHAEL] Really.
[MICHAEL] Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.
[MICHAEL] Wow. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.
[MICHAEL] I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
[MICHAEL] No, today at work.
[MICHAEL] Yes. I kind of arranged it.
[MICHAEL] That is so sweet. You are the best GD girlfriend in the world. Do you know that?
[MICHAEL] You are. You are.
[MICHAEL] How you doin'? You excited.
[MICHAEL] Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
[MICHAEL] You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous...
[MICHAEL] Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
[MICHAEL] Here, let me...
[MICHAEL] Just cover up that bald patch.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] That's ok.
[MICHAEL] This is bull****!
[MICHAEL] Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
[MICHAEL] Oh, shiii...
[MICHAEL] Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
[MICHAEL] Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
[MICHAEL] I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
[MICHAEL] I will take care of that.
[MICHAEL] Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance. One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige...
[MICHAEL] is a guy that...
[MICHAEL] he works... Okay hold, hold on, hold on. Look. Look. I didn't say anything when Phyllis' dad upstaged me at the ceremony. And I think you owe me this. Kay.
[MICHAEL] No. I'm not going to...
[MICHAEL] Ok. All right.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!
[MICHAEL] Dwight, just...
[MICHAEL] Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] We are great together. We are a great team.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.
[MICHAEL] Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
[MICHAEL] You're... You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] Huh?
[MICHAEL] Pop quiz.
[MICHAEL] Why is today a special day?
[MICHAEL] Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
[MICHAEL] In business school, Kevin. Business school.
[MICHAEL] A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for that: "May your hats fly as high as your dreams." ... That was a pretty good line.
[MICHAEL] I understand! Wow. Relax, spazzy boy. Sometimes you're such a little spaz!  Whoa, hey!
[MICHAEL] We have fun.
[MICHAEL] I can't hear what he's saying, but he looks like he's really into it.
[MICHAEL] Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  You cannot learn from books. Replace these pages with life lessons, and then, you will have... a book... that is worth its weight in gold.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of business: Tourism. Food service. Railroads, and sales. And hospitals slash manufacturing. And air travel.
[MICHAEL] ...And products!
[MICHAEL] Well... okay, I was just kind of getting it going. Um, alright. Well, okay, we can do questions. Okay. Very good. First hand up.
[MICHAEL] We can't overestimate the value of computers. Yes, they are great for playing games and forwarding funny emails. But real business is done on paper, okay? Write that down.
[MICHAEL] ...I say you will miss our service, and I absolutely guarantee you'll come back.
[MICHAEL] ...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid.
[MICHAEL] Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index?
[MICHAEL] Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here?
[MICHAEL] ...Wait, Ryan said that?
[MICHAEL] David will always beat Goliath.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah. You know what else is facing five Goliaths? America. Al-Qaeda, global warming, s*x predators... mercury poisoning. So do we just give up? Is that what we're learning in business school?
[MICHAEL] Dunder-Mifflin is the big picture! Can't you understand that? No, you can't. You're too young. Ryan... has never made a sale. And he started a fire trying to make a cheesy pita. And everybody thinks he's a tease. Well you know what? He doesn't know anything, and neither do you.  SO SUCK ON THAT!
[MICHAEL] Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
[MICHAEL] You heard me, pack your things.
[MICHAEL] Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
[MICHAEL] A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
[MICHAEL] Pam-casso! Sorry I'm late, I had to race across town.
[MICHAEL] Wow! You did these... freehand?
[MICHAEL] My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much?
[MICHAEL] I don't see a... price.
[MICHAEL] Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
[MICHAEL] That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] ...Chunky. Do you want half?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] And now, the chains.
[MICHAEL] No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
[MICHAEL] I will get out. Oh yes, I will.
[MICHAEL] No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Pam, would you smell my breath?
[MICHAEL] Sure? Might be a good idea.
[MICHAEL] Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
[MICHAEL] Play some games?
[MICHAEL] I spy?
[MICHAEL] Oh, sure. Really didn't give it any thought. Wait, should you be going?  Heh-woh you.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Buttercup.
[MICHAEL] I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
[MICHAEL] That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] Uh, yes you are.
[MICHAEL] No problem.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Jan. Jan? This party is actually a really big step for us. So, I...
[MICHAEL] Ummm... I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Maybe.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Alright. Bye.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
[MICHAEL] I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] No, it's not.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
[MICHAEL] Awesome. I'm going to frame mine. I could frame yours too.
[MICHAEL] Over our love.
[MICHAEL] You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
[MICHAEL] It's a heart.
[MICHAEL] Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything. Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
[MICHAEL] Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, but you're great now, right? We're all great. Aren't we great?
[MICHAEL] I could go for an appeteaser.
[MICHAEL] Bagel bites or something.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
[MICHAEL] David, how much did this house cost?
[MICHAEL] Here is to Mr. Iacocca and his failed experiment, the De Lorean.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Do you have any ice?
[MICHAEL] How about some Splenda?
[MICHAEL] You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas.
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah, they don't allow kids at Sandals. They are persona non gratis... there. But it's fun. It's an awesome place. You would not believe how low this girl can limbo.
[MICHAEL] Crazy.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no.
[MICHAEL] Come on, let's go back to the party.
[MICHAEL] Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
[MICHAEL] I'm not going to slam you up against the wall.
[MICHAEL] You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
[MICHAEL] You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
[MICHAEL] Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly.
[MICHAEL] I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces.
[MICHAEL] I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
[MICHAEL] Whatever.
[MICHAEL] That's all, you didn't mean it?
[MICHAEL] I love you, Jan.
[MICHAEL] It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.
[MICHAEL] No...
[MICHAEL] No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.
[MICHAEL] Yeppers.
[MICHAEL] I don't... remember.
[MICHAEL] Yeesh...
[MICHAEL] Wikipedia.
[MICHAEL] Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl. I think...  that maybe you should...
[MICHAEL] What I'm saying is that,
[MICHAEL] Ok, see what I did?
[MICHAEL] By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.
[MICHAEL] Ok, let's try another one. Um...
[MICHAEL] Walking out of the room unexpectedly.
[MICHAEL] It's a surprise.
[MICHAEL] Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] No, what did you say?
[MICHAEL] Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
[MICHAEL] Yes, yeah, absolutely. Have a seat.
[MICHAEL] You know what? Actually, let's go into the conference room.
[MICHAEL] No, you know what? Let's stay here. No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
[MICHAEL] Hmm. Ohh, Darryl. You are a good worker, and a good man. I just, you know, times are tight. And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] No, this is a power suit.
[MICHAEL] I do not buy woman's clothes. I would not make that mistake again.
[MICHAEL] Ohh... kay.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Alright, you know what? Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?
[MICHAEL] No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK? I got this out of a bin.
[MICHAEL] Uh,  MISSterious. And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Would you stop it, please?
[MICHAEL] It's European, OK? It's a European cut.
[MICHAEL] No, they don't. See?
[MICHAEL] No, I don't want to do that because I'm twice your size anyway.
[MICHAEL] Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
[MICHAEL] That was a very good point.
[MICHAEL] You make a very compelling argument.
[MICHAEL] Because, that is the way these things are done. In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes.
[MICHAEL] Oh.  Come on. Be serious.
[MICHAEL] I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
[MICHAEL] I don't. Want me to prove it to you? There is... a pay stub.
[MICHAEL] Plus perks, yes.
[MICHAEL] Fourteen years.
[MICHAEL] No, please, please...
[MICHAEL] Ok, let's take 15, again.
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you.
[MICHAEL] I didn't give you $40.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay, here's the straight... dope. No tricks. No Wikipedia.
[MICHAEL] I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
[MICHAEL] Well what am I supposed to do?
[MICHAEL] I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now. That is ridiculous.
[MICHAEL] You know what? I should.
[MICHAEL] I have been a loyal employee for a long time.
[MICHAEL] You know what? I deserve a bump.
[MICHAEL] I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
[MICHAEL] No, Jan. I've never asked for a raise in 14 years. This is long overdue. I wanna do it today.
[MICHAEL] Yshhyah. Um, yeah. I'll leave right away.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hm.
[MICHAEL] Hey, I'd rather kill myself.
[MICHAEL] No, Toby is terrible. Toby is the worst human being I've ever known.
[MICHAEL] Fine.
[MICHAEL] Toby, come on. Let's go.
[MICHAEL] Where? I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer. Come on, let's go.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Fine.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Mm, the Big Apple.
[MICHAEL] Maybe I'll stay.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Oh, I...
[MICHAEL] Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Who's the boy toy?
[MICHAEL] Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
[MICHAEL] Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
[MICHAEL] Pippity poppity.
[MICHAEL] Six percent? After all we've been through?
[MICHAEL] I got you... jade earrings.
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] No. You gonna play it like this? You give me a good raise, or no more s*x.   What are you writing, perv-ball?
[MICHAEL] Okay, no, no, no, no. You do not try tactic number eight on me. I invented tactic number eight. I'm not going anywhere.
[MICHAEL] Ohh. It was a weird day. I accidentally cross-dressed. And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money. And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby. And then, your assistant, is all young and hot. And I---
[MICHAEL] Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
[MICHAEL] Ah, so... All right, Levinson. Here's the rub. I would like a 15% raise.
[MICHAEL] But you just said 15.
[MICHAEL] I can, and I have.
[MICHAEL] Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.  Pudge has driven the forklift.
[MICHAEL] I thought your name was Pudge?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Um, her.
[MICHAEL] Ah, fine.
[MICHAEL] Yeeesh.
[MICHAEL] Bail'er? I hardly know her.
[MICHAEL] Yes, yes. But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
[MICHAEL] It's a big red trash compactor!
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay! I got it. I got it. ... Only on the rarest of occasions...
[MICHAEL] ...would I go near---
[MICHAEL] Yes, good. Fine. Like stretching and...
[MICHAEL] Wow, that is... that time really adds up. That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
[MICHAEL] Ok, you know what? You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff. Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
[MICHAEL] Ok, you know what? I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.  Sorry, he is very lame.  Um, let's see. "Seasonal affective disorder! A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."
[MICHAEL] Ok guys, you know what? I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Okay, let's do another one. This is a good one. "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"
[MICHAEL] Yes. "Which can contribute to heart disease." Heart disease kills more people that balers.
[MICHAEL] Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours. So, I---
[MICHAEL] Okay. ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
[MICHAEL] Working in an office can lead to depression. Which can lead to suicide. I mean this is really serious stuff.
[MICHAEL] I--- I--- Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
[MICHAEL] Yeah... you are... ah, so right. They had visual aids. And all we had were the facts. You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity. You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
[MICHAEL] Indubitably.
[MICHAEL] I don't know, I don't know. Because you know what our killer is? Depression---
[MICHAEL] Nn--- Depression.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Maybe we should test it first. Letterman-style. Throw a TV over, or...
[MICHAEL] Go buy some watermelons.
[MICHAEL] Just...
[MICHAEL] Let's do it! Drop that sucker.
[MICHAEL] Find out whose car that is. If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
[MICHAEL] Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
[MICHAEL] Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
[MICHAEL] Yes, thank you for seeing that.
[MICHAEL] I don't know if I wanna do this.
[MICHAEL] No. No more. The tests are going terrible. If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump. This is about doing, not thinking.
[MICHAEL] Rock n' roll!
[MICHAEL] That's right! I am not thinking.
[MICHAEL] Yes! Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Woo!
[MICHAEL] Woo!
[MICHAEL] I am ready to do this! I am ready to make a point!
[MICHAEL] My life! Oh, my life...
[MICHAEL] Everything's wrong. The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, you ignorant slut. Depression is a very serious illness. Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year! According to a 2004 study!
[MICHAEL] Yes! My head is in such pain! And turmoil!
[MICHAEL] Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
[MICHAEL] Okay... that's...
[MICHAEL] That's the whole point, dummy.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Oooooh, my life!
[MICHAEL] Everything is wrong, Dwight. The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, you ignorant slut.
[MICHAEL] And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
[MICHAEL] Damn it.
[MICHAEL] What is it?
[MICHAEL] Dwight, find out what the present is.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, you are such a liar. Pam, really, what is it?
[MICHAEL] You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
[MICHAEL] What do I have to live for?
[MICHAEL] It's complicated with Jan. And I don't know where I stand, or what I want. The s*x isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
[MICHAEL] I'm braver than you?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
[MICHAEL] It is disgusting. I totally agree. Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
[MICHAEL] Crisis Management Squad.
[MICHAEL] Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go. Any other questions?
[MICHAEL] To save time, Jim.
[MICHAEL] You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh! Forget it. Where is Creed?
[MICHAEL] Creed. Quality assurance. Your job. I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed. Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. Not good enough. This is a keystone account. I want you in the school. In person.
[MICHAEL] I want you to bring a partner.
[MICHAEL] No, sweet cheeks. We need someone who's actually made a sale. Andy, you go.
[MICHAEL] No, no. I need two men on this. That's what she said. No time! But she did. NO TIME! Guys, get on this. Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
[MICHAEL] No, Pam. The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
[MICHAEL] So, let us consider this matter ended.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know you're angry. And we are truly, truly sorry.
[MICHAEL] Well, we are extremely sorry.
[MICHAEL] The watermark... it's a one time thing.
[MICHAEL] OK...
[MICHAEL] Well...  OK, well... Um, wasn't really my fault. The guys at the papermill---
[MICHAEL] The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
[MICHAEL] No, I'm a regional manager---
[MICHAEL] No--- my--- OK, this is insane. You can get out of here. Get out!
[MICHAEL] That's insane. We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
[MICHAEL] Doesn't matter. Out please!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that?
[MICHAEL] No, then Newsweek picks it up. And then CNN does a story about it. Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
[MICHAEL] You're right. It will blow over. But it's not... going to take... a week or two.  Do you know what this is for?
[MICHAEL] That's how devoted I am to this job.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] I understand that, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight? And now we're wasting tape. I'm gonna have to cut this all out. Can you say cut?
[MICHAEL] So I'll know where---
[MICHAEL] I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
[MICHAEL] OK, ready?
[MICHAEL] That's... they always give an ultimatum.
[MICHAEL] Good, cut?
[MICHAEL] Thought so too.
[MICHAEL] What's happening?
[MICHAEL] Really? Is she OK?
[MICHAEL] OK.  Phyllis, you say?  Hmm.
[MICHAEL] Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?  OK.  He's back!  OK. Hmm.  Waagh!
[MICHAEL] What? Oh.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh...
[MICHAEL] Oh, come on. We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
[MICHAEL] Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
[MICHAEL] Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your pen1s.  I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
[MICHAEL] Huh?
[MICHAEL] I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
[MICHAEL] Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
[MICHAEL] I... uh, well, I don't know.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid.
[MICHAEL] OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
[MICHAEL] See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
[MICHAEL] No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
[MICHAEL] Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
[MICHAEL] That is not current.
[MICHAEL] You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
[MICHAEL] Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
[MICHAEL] OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a pen1s, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
[MICHAEL] No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
[MICHAEL] I have to know whether you're serious or not.
[MICHAEL] Ye - OK, yes.
[MICHAEL] You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
[MICHAEL] Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese.
[MICHAEL] What, um... what do you think of role-play?
[MICHAEL] Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
[MICHAEL] I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
[MICHAEL] Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during s*x.
[MICHAEL] And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
[MICHAEL] No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
[MICHAEL] No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
[MICHAEL] No... No, it's all right. I'm OK. I'm OK.  You guys... what are we gonna do about Jan?
[MICHAEL] OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
[MICHAEL] Cons. Wears too much makeup. Breasts: not anything to write home about. Insecure about body. I'm unhappy when I'm with her. Flat-chested.
[MICHAEL] She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
[MICHAEL] I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
[MICHAEL] I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having s*x.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, that's smart.
[MICHAEL] That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
[MICHAEL] I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Oh, no.  It's Jan. What do I do?
[MICHAEL] OK, it stopped.
[MICHAEL] Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see.  There we go!  Good. Yes, we have the... all right.
[MICHAEL] Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
[MICHAEL] Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
[MICHAEL] You know what? I need my girls with me. Pam, Karen, even Phyllis. Come on. Let's do this. Let's do it.
[MICHAEL] I love you guys. Now I'm getting her voicemail.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Jan. It's me, Michael. I'm just calling to say that I think we need a little break, permanently. And, uh, I know everybody says this, but I-I wanna remain friends. Or at least business associates who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you.  OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Abso-fruit-ly.
[MICHAEL] No... No...
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Maybe some Italian.  "... to remain friends. Or at least business associates -"  Chinese?  "who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy."
[MICHAEL] Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
[MICHAEL] Right there.
[MICHAEL] Maybe.
[MICHAEL] Not it. I don't have eggs.
[MICHAEL] That's possible.
[MICHAEL] Uh-huh?
[MICHAEL] The CFO? Ohh...
[MICHAEL] And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?
[MICHAEL] Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
[MICHAEL] ...you just gots to get your freak on.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Hmmm.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
[MICHAEL] May God guide you in your quest.
[MICHAEL] Well, you can't swim in leather pants.  I'm just yankin' your chain. Not literally.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
[MICHAEL] Hey Pam, I have a very important job for you
[MICHAEL] We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
[MICHAEL] I want you to write down everything that people are doing all day. And then type it up, in a way that is helpful. Alright?
[MICHAEL] If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
[MICHAEL] Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus. Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities. Funtivities! And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
[MICHAEL] Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down?
[MICHAEL] Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
[MICHAEL] Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
[MICHAEL] Alright, find a cozy spot. Everybody settle in.  OK, everybody up! Circle 'round.  Let us play some games. We are situated on the northeast corner of scenic Lake Scranton. America's eighth largest indigenous body of water. It is here that a group of Americans will undergo the ultimate challenge. One day, 14 strangers who work together, but only one survivor.
[MICHAEL] Just words. Inspiring words.  Not a contender.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
[MICHAEL] Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
[MICHAEL] I'm not playing.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey. Ok, Ok... Stanley, your team name?
[MICHAEL] Then I will name your team the Red team.
[MICHAEL] Very good. Pam, please take a note that Andy is patriotic.
[MICHAEL] Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!
[MICHAEL] Pam...you're missing things.
[MICHAEL] Smart as a whip! Yes!  These are pre-cooked, so it's not absolutely necessary, but I would appreciate it if you could heat up 800 hot dogs for a little contest I'm going to be having. I would greatly appreciate it.
[MICHAEL] Like umm... ten minutes?
[MICHAEL] Thanks a bunch.
[MICHAEL] No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
[MICHAEL] Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
[MICHAEL] No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
[MICHAEL] I can't say.
[MICHAEL] The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
[MICHAEL] The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright?
[MICHAEL] I didn't want to tell anyway. I didn't want to cast a pall over our fun beach day. But you know what? I don't know who to recommend because frankly nobody is stepping up.
[MICHAEL] Word.  There we go. Let's see it.
[MICHAEL] 13 hot dogs, everybody!
[MICHAEL] Probably left them in the trunk of my car. It's alright. It's alright. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Aaaaaand, go!
[MICHAEL] Nice, Stanley!
[MICHAEL] One. Two. Three.
[MICHAEL] Excellent!
[MICHAEL] Check to see if there is a conversion chart in that notebook.
[MICHAEL] Please just check.
[MICHAEL] Your loss, Stanley. Meanwhile the rest of us will have a super fun time defeating our fear and creating a lasting memory. Walking through FIRE!
[MICHAEL] No. No, not you, Pam. You have to keep score.
[MICHAEL] Pointless.
[MICHAEL] Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up.
[MICHAEL] Ji.. why not? C'mon.
[MICHAEL] You do not have what it takes to be a regional manager.
[MICHAEL] Who's next? Andy? Where's Andy? Andy is never here today.
[MICHAEL] Because I already did. Remember? I burned my foot on a George Foreman grill.
[MICHAEL] Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay.  The mind has to wrap around the foot.  Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Count to three, please.
[MICHAEL] Count the other way. Count... no, no, count one, two, three, not three, two, one.
[MICHAEL] Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Don't, don't.
[MICHAEL] I'm not going to give it to you.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Ummm, hmm... True. Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor.
[MICHAEL] God! He's a comedian.
[MICHAEL] Who's Amanda Bynes?
[MICHAEL] Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope. So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got.
[MICHAEL] You are being too modest.
[MICHAEL] Hhhh... okay. That is not funny. I am deducting sixty points from Voldemort for false pretenses. Okay, Dwight your turn. Wow us.
[MICHAEL] That is a very, very funny story.
[MICHAEL] Pam, that was amazing. But I am still looking for someone with a sales background.
[MICHAEL] WWWWIIIILLLLMMMMAAAA!
[MICHAEL] Are we all set?
[MICHAEL] Yes. I just happened to be in the neighborhood, thought I'd drop in and say hello.
[MICHAEL] Thought I'd catch a show.
[MICHAEL] Naaah. You know what? Since I'm here, let me ask you a few questions about the job.
[MICHAEL] Um, how many people are you interviewing?
[MICHAEL] Ah, well, good. Out of curiosity are you interviewing anyone who has been here longer than I have, or manages more people?
[MICHAEL] Great. One more... question. When you merged those branches who did you put in charge?
[MICHAEL] Ah, great. No further questions.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] And I'm really looking forward to working with you.
[MICHAEL] Yes, the time has come to name my own replacement. So please hand this letter of congratulations to Dwight K. Schrute.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Uh...
[MICHAEL] Uh, okay.
[MICHAEL] Stop crying.
[MICHAEL] Ohhhhh...
[MICHAEL] Why so you can do it?
[MICHAEL] No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know? Convoys are really fun. Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger...
[MICHAEL] Moon each other.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Your loss.
[MICHAEL] Cruise control.
[MICHAEL] No. Not at all. I haven't talked to Jan since we broke up, and I think if she had something to say she would have called me.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I...
[MICHAEL] I have to buy another place.
[MICHAEL] I sold it on eBay. The buyer was very motivated, as was I. It went for eighty percent of what I paid. Sold in record time.
[MICHAEL] Why... are you here?
[MICHAEL] I'm good. How are you, Janet? It's good to see you.
[MICHAEL] Why privately?
[MICHAEL] Okay, sure, fine. Um, why don't you wait in my office. I have some important business matters to take care of.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Uh, I may need some immediate assistance. If you would slowly and quietly gather the ladies in the conference room. Phyllis, Angela, Karen.
[MICHAEL] No. She's an alternate.
[MICHAEL] Good.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Weird. Yeah, I didn't get both of your messages.
[MICHAEL] Hmm.
[MICHAEL] Sound good. Sounds fun.
[MICHAEL] Hmm..
[MICHAEL] Would you excuse me for a second?
[MICHAEL] I don't know, that's why you're here, help me. Please...
[MICHAEL] No, no. What do I do?
[MICHAEL] What if she makes me?
[MICHAEL] She made me do a lot of things I didn't wanna do.
[MICHAEL] I wasn't.
[MICHAEL] You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm gonna go in there and tell her that we can't be together.
[MICHAEL] Wow.
[MICHAEL] I'm in a very good place right now. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] First got priorities.
[MICHAEL] Let's get back together.
[MICHAEL] Wait, wait. Check one more time.
[MICHAEL] Very good
[MICHAEL] Yes, indeed.
[MICHAEL] Your advice was good, but Jan's was bigger.
[MICHAEL] I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names. If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, just... that's not his real name. That's just what I call him, so...
[MICHAEL] Jan in yet?
[MICHAEL] Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
[MICHAEL] Just say, "I want to squeeze them." It's code. She'll know what it means.
[MICHAEL] Oh, and Hunter? Could you tell her,  "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
[MICHAEL] Good to see you. Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
[MICHAEL] Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are? I work too hard. I care too much. And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
[MICHAEL] Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin. I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great. Where great paper is our passion. We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!" I don't know, could be good. Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper. It's super duper." I don't know, something like that.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Yes. And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.  Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
[MICHAEL] I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Pretty good.
[MICHAEL] Could have gone better I guess.
[MICHAEL] Cool. Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
[MICHAEL] Daaah, let's just run away together. Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow. You have some savings right? You could pay off my debts. It would... be fine. We'd have fun.
[MICHAEL] I can't tell you.
[MICHAEL] Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
[MICHAEL] No--- We're all unstable.
[MICHAEL] David, I did not tell her.
[MICHAEL] So, I am gonna... give her a ride home. Let me know about the job.
[MICHAEL] Good, I'm glad we're on the same page. I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
[MICHAEL] You know what? That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job. That's not being a good boyfriend. So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration. Do you accept my withdrawal?
[MICHAEL] Good. Very good. I'm glad we are finally on the same page. Still have my job in Scranton, though.
[MICHAEL] Good. That's all I ever wanted. These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates.
[MICHAEL] Well, it's...  No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
[MICHAEL] I don't know.  Well I guess... you could come and stay at my condo. I think I could back out of the sale.  Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
[MICHAEL] No. No, Pam. I'm baaaaaack! For gooood! Kevin Nealon.
[MICHAEL] That's stupid.
[MICHAEL] You shouldn't have taken it. Bad management! Good thing I'm baaaaaack.  Ryan, coffee.
[MICHAEL] No, it's for me, bimbo. Kids.
[MICHAEL] Back to work.  Still waitin' on that coffee.
[MICHAEL] It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
[MICHAEL] Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
[MICHAEL] It was an accident.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
[MICHAEL] No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
[MICHAEL] Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
[MICHAEL] Oh, right, I'm sorry. What is: we are fine?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
[MICHAEL] So, like a freedom tree.
[MICHAEL] Pam.
[MICHAEL] Pam.
[MICHAEL] Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
[MICHAEL] Excellent!
[MICHAEL] Good work Pam.
[MICHAEL] Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
[MICHAEL] Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
[MICHAEL] No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
[MICHAEL] No... She's in a coma.
[MICHAEL] OK... Meredith,  Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go.  Tie these up, cheer up your tubes...  Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!
[MICHAEL] Nurse.
[MICHAEL] I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
[MICHAEL] Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
[MICHAEL] Well, just shhhh... just just...
[MICHAEL] Look, I just... I don't understand what is preventing you from laughing this off and giving me a big hug.
[MICHAEL] Come on.
[MICHAEL] OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...
[MICHAEL] Sprinkles?
[MICHAEL] Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
[MICHAEL] Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
[MICHAEL] Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
[MICHAEL] Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
[MICHAEL] Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
[MICHAEL] Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Are you sure?
[MICHAEL] What are you?
[MICHAEL] OK, 1 Sikh, and...
[MICHAEL] Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine.
[MICHAEL] Oh God, Rabies?
[MICHAEL] I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
[MICHAEL] This place is so cursed.
[MICHAEL] I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
[MICHAEL] Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people!  Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.
[MICHAEL] Pro-Am.
[MICHAEL] Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
[MICHAEL] Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
[MICHAEL] That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?
[MICHAEL] Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Alright, alright.
[MICHAEL] Shhh...
[MICHAEL] I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
[MICHAEL] OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
[MICHAEL] Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
[MICHAEL] Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
[MICHAEL] What about a rabies nurse?
[MICHAEL] That's possible. Look into that.
[MICHAEL] Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
[MICHAEL] Come in.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] No I didn't, just please don't...
[MICHAEL] May I enter the room?
[MICHAEL] See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
[MICHAEL] Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
[MICHAEL] European offices are naked all the time.
[MICHAEL] Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
[MICHAEL] That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.
[MICHAEL] OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies.  That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. Myth: 3 Americans every year die from rabies. Fact: 4 Americans every year die from rabies. How many of you know someone who has been afflicted or affected by rabies? Show of hands. One, two, three... too many to count. It is truly the silent killer. No, it is the foaming barking killer. And it is something... Darryl what are you doing.
[MICHAEL] No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
[MICHAEL] He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse?  This is the reason we're here.
[MICHAEL] Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
[MICHAEL] Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
[MICHAEL] OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
[MICHAEL] Beow!
[MICHAEL] I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.
[MICHAEL] No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
[MICHAEL] Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
[MICHAEL] Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
[MICHAEL] I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...
[MICHAEL] What do you want me to do Jim?
[MICHAEL] No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
[MICHAEL] That's a good deal.
[MICHAEL] Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
[MICHAEL] You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
[MICHAEL] You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my pen1s. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k  No, no!
[MICHAEL] Hey Mer. How ya doing?
[MICHAEL] It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
[MICHAEL] Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore.  Wanna share?
[MICHAEL] I'm not really sick.  Nah, I'm good.
[MICHAEL] I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
[MICHAEL] Oh really.
[MICHAEL] Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
[MICHAEL] No way.
[MICHAEL] Woooah! Wow!
[MICHAEL] Awesome!
[MICHAEL] You guys! Yes! Yes!
[MICHAEL] Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Come on. Come here. Okay, okay,  stand up.  OK, here we go.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
[MICHAEL] I love you guys, so much.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Blowing up balloons I thought.
[MICHAEL] Hey!
[MICHAEL] There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
[MICHAEL] Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
[MICHAEL] ...business meeting --
[MICHAEL] That's right! That's right!
[MICHAEL] Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] Look how big he is. Look at you, you are so mature and old and little man now. You're like our little man...
[MICHAEL] Beard.
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow!
[MICHAEL] That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
[MICHAEL] Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
[MICHAEL] Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?
[MICHAEL] Sounds good. OK, alright.
[MICHAEL] OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[MICHAEL] Ryan Howard everybody.  Good job.
[MICHAEL] Who is?
[MICHAEL] I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
[MICHAEL] Good, so, we're on the same page?
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
[MICHAEL] Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] What is that... word?
[MICHAEL] So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
[MICHAEL] Good, we're all here, we can get started.
[MICHAEL] Have a seat.
[MICHAEL] Have a seat. Like everybody else.
[MICHAEL] Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
[MICHAEL] Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
[MICHAEL] No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Or the funny things that they can do, like "where's the Beef?"   Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
[MICHAEL] That is me. Come on in.  Who is this old fart? Did you just stagger off the street? Out of a box or something? Who's this worthless bag of bones? Well, this guy is none other than one of the founders of Dunder Mifflin, Mr. Robert Dunder. Huh?
[MICHAEL] Sure thing.  'Scuse me.
[MICHAEL] Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
[MICHAEL] Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?
[MICHAEL] Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
[MICHAEL] Wow.
[MICHAEL] Oh, boy.
[MICHAEL] Great.
[MICHAEL] Great.
[MICHAEL] That's great. Thank you for coming in.  Robert Dunder everybody.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?
[MICHAEL] Perfect.
[MICHAEL] Inspirational. What have we learned? Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail.
[MICHAEL] No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam.  What a nice guy.
[MICHAEL] I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
[MICHAEL] I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
[MICHAEL] No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
[MICHAEL] Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.
[MICHAEL] I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
[MICHAEL] With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.
[MICHAEL] Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
[MICHAEL] Yes?
[MICHAEL] OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
[MICHAEL] Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
[MICHAEL] Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
[MICHAEL] No, this is my quest.
[MICHAEL] Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
[MICHAEL] We don't need luck.
[MICHAEL] But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
[MICHAEL] It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
[MICHAEL] I know. So who's next?
[MICHAEL] Who?
[MICHAEL] Yes we do.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm.
[MICHAEL] OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
[MICHAEL] Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] That is true.
[MICHAEL] Yes, she is nuts.
[MICHAEL] How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
[MICHAEL] Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?
[MICHAEL] She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.
[MICHAEL] OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?
[MICHAEL] Ah... .is that all you have to say?
[MICHAEL] Look, we want you back.
[MICHAEL] Well, no.
[MICHAEL] No it's not.
[MICHAEL] Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
[MICHAEL] Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.
[MICHAEL] Great, the magic of the gift basket.
[MICHAEL] OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.
[MICHAEL] I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
[MICHAEL] That is a very good point, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] No, it said right, it said take a right.
[MICHAEL] Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
[MICHAEL] The machine knows where it is going!
[MICHAEL] The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
[MICHAEL] Let go, let go of me!
[MICHAEL] Good, that is what's most important.
[MICHAEL] These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
[MICHAEL] What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
[MICHAEL] Hang up.  You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
[MICHAEL] We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!
[MICHAEL] Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, maybe we should, maybe we should leave. Come on, let's leave, but before we leave my wet friend and I are going to wait for our cabs on yours nice couches!
[MICHAEL] Look, my clothes are so wet!
[MICHAEL] It's been opened.
[MICHAEL] What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?
[MICHAEL] WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
[MICHAEL] Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
[MICHAEL] I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
[MICHAEL] Exactly!
[MICHAEL] Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
[MICHAEL] Yeah! I know. I know. It's bland.
[MICHAEL] Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
[MICHAEL] Like, something that you have to look for. Sort of a "Where's Waldo."
[MICHAEL] Alright. Alright. Let's quit while we're ahead.
[MICHAEL] That was awesome. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Oh, does he?
[MICHAEL] Mmmmmm. Okay. Attention. Earthlings. I have some news. Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep. Okay. Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people. On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
[MICHAEL] No. It doesn't. I'll find out tonight.
[MICHAEL] What's that, pipsqueak?
[MICHAEL] Ohh, lunch party.
[MICHAEL] Okay, wow! Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] It's the European cut.
[MICHAEL] Umm... hey. Ah, what's hanging?
[MICHAEL] Oh good. Okay cool. How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
[MICHAEL] I had um, one of those danishes.
[MICHAEL] Just...
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Na... no. No. If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.
[MICHAEL] Do I have your permission to invite Carol?
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just the first... girl that popped into my head. I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
[MICHAEL] Alright. Well fight it out amongst yourselves. I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
[MICHAEL] Just let me know who the winner is.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah, you'd better. You better say good-bye to Pam. Say good-bye to Pam. Byyyyyye. I love you.  I love ya Pam... okay.  I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again. Yes I do. Tomorrow I'll be back. I'll be back. Tomorrow. Um... yeah. So you know what? Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
[MICHAEL] If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster. See you guys tomorrow.
[MICHAEL] Got it for Ryan. Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out. Figured...
[MICHAEL] Same sort of stuff in here.
[MICHAEL] Mmwa. Mmwa.
[MICHAEL] Leaving Pennsylvania.
[MICHAEL] One for me one for Jan.
[MICHAEL] You guys should come over for dinner. You and Pam. That'd be fun. Friday?
[MICHAEL] Wanna come over Friday?
[MICHAEL] After work you guys...
[MICHAEL] Yes. Actually I will tell you right now. It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password. So...
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm sure that's not. Na...
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I withdrew too.
[MICHAEL] Ohhh, what? Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
[MICHAEL] I think I faked Stanley out too. Who else thought that I was leaving? And they could all go home early? Gotcha. Gotcha. Gotcha. Well who needs New York? Right? We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
[MICHAEL] Nope nope nope no. This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning. This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come. What's wrong with Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Oh hey! Good for you. Good for you. Scranton power. Alright you know what? Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on. Good.
[MICHAEL] Good. These are some things that I would like to have happen.
[MICHAEL] Mmmhmm.
[MICHAEL] Those are just things. This is how I want it to feel.
[MICHAEL] I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important...
[MICHAEL] Yes
[MICHAEL] Uh...
[MICHAEL] I want it...
[MICHAEL] I want it to embarrass all other parties. I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"
[MICHAEL] Yes you can.
[MICHAEL] Yes you can. I know you can. I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it. Who else could do this?
[MICHAEL] No seriously. Is there anyone else who could do it better? Because we don't have a lot of time. I'll get the pizza!
[MICHAEL] Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
[MICHAEL] Same thing.
[MICHAEL] You know what? I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
[MICHAEL] Pizza by Alfredo.
[MICHAEL] You don't have to say it like that.
[MICHAEL] Hey
[MICHAEL] Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.
[MICHAEL] You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
[MICHAEL] Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.
[MICHAEL] It is your problem. That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off. End of story.
[MICHAEL] I'm not giving that to you.
[MICHAEL] No, no you're not going anywhere. You're staying here until we figure this out.
[MICHAEL] You know what? This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people. I don't care if it's pizza. Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through. You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you? Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room. Right now, get in the conference room.
[MICHAEL] Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza. Please, thank you.
[MICHAEL] No, you don't even know what stupid is. It's about to get all stupid up in here.
[MICHAEL] Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?
[MICHAEL] Alright, Dwight, knock it off. You better think about what you are doing young man.
[MICHAEL] No! I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything. You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales. So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?
[MICHAEL] Yeah sales, you sell pizza. Last time I checked that's called sales.
[MICHAEL] Alright stop, stop making him say it! You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
[MICHAEL] Stop talking all at once!
[MICHAEL] Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
[MICHAEL] You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
[MICHAEL] I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.
[MICHAEL] I think you're over-thinking it.
[MICHAEL] Yes, is Alfredo there? Can I speak to a manager then? Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered. Yes, I know it is not on the coupon. Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
[MICHAEL] Trouble. Okay, alright.
[MICHAEL] He said no.
[MICHAEL] No, no.
[MICHAEL] Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?
[MICHAEL] I'll just wave and introduce myself.
[MICHAEL] Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
[MICHAEL] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey stop it. Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no. I kidnapped a kid.
[MICHAEL] I could have paid for the pizza.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God, oh my God.
[MICHAEL] You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
[MICHAEL] Mmm-kay. I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
[MICHAEL] I will open the door.
[MICHAEL] And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] See ya, drive safely.
[MICHAEL] Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
[MICHAEL] Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
[MICHAEL] Bluh.
[MICHAEL] Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth. I'd really like some sushi. I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today. And you know what?
[MICHAEL] I'm going to get it.
[MICHAEL] Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
[MICHAEL] New York. Wanna go?
[MICHAEL] Alright, you drive.
[MICHAEL] Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Mmm.
[MICHAEL] Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, let's go.
[MICHAEL] Guilty.
[MICHAEL] Oh, thanks. This is the guy that beat the computer.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed. I got egg all over my face.
[MICHAEL] I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
[MICHAEL] I made it with my cheese pita.
[MICHAEL] I started a fire, I started a fire.
[MICHAEL] And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
[MICHAEL] Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
[MICHAEL] On the phone.
[MICHAEL] Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
[MICHAEL] Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
[MICHAEL] I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
[MICHAEL] We already have a sofa. So why do---
[MICHAEL] It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
[MICHAEL] I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
[MICHAEL] Put him through. Yes. Ryan, my man!
[MICHAEL] Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
[MICHAEL] Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
[MICHAEL] Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
[MICHAEL] Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
[MICHAEL] You can not, I have a thing tonight.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
[MICHAEL] How about this weekend?
[MICHAEL] Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
[MICHAEL] You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
[MICHAEL] Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call.
[MICHAEL] No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
[MICHAEL] These meetings are useless.
[MICHAEL] Very inspirational.
[MICHAEL] Or a trained seal.
[MICHAEL] I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
[MICHAEL] ...Stanley?
[MICHAEL] Senor, are you happy with your---
[MICHAEL] Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
[MICHAEL] You bet.
[MICHAEL] Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
[MICHAEL] It is not a waste of our time.
[MICHAEL] Vikram doesn't have my people skills.
[MICHAEL] Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
[MICHAEL] Oh, that looks good.
[MICHAEL] I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Wonder what I would've been back home?
[MICHAEL] I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
[MICHAEL] I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
[MICHAEL] I actually wrote a movie.
[MICHAEL] I'm writing one, yeah.
[MICHAEL] Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
[MICHAEL] Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.
[MICHAEL] Okay, see you guys.  Hey, how you doin'?
[MICHAEL] Okay. How's yoga?
[MICHAEL] Wh-Why not?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Good night Vikram.
[MICHAEL] Hey, congrats on the bonus.
[MICHAEL] I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
[MICHAEL] Good night.
[MICHAEL] Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
[MICHAEL] Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
[MICHAEL] My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
[MICHAEL] What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
[MICHAEL] It won't.
[MICHAEL] Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.
[MICHAEL] Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
[MICHAEL] Huh, okay.
[MICHAEL] It's whoever, not whomever.
[MICHAEL] No, whomever is never actually right.
[MICHAEL] Not a native speaker.
[MICHAEL] Well it sounds right, but is it?
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
[MICHAEL] And the other I was a Regional Manager of a small paper supply company called Dunder Mifflin.
[MICHAEL] In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me. But the truth is, I can't do this.
[MICHAEL] I am.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself. You know, just a little bit of money. Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times. I don't know, kind of just for fun. I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things. Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something. Like, who do I call about that?
[MICHAEL] Do you know anybody in the mob?
[MICHAEL] Hey guys.
[MICHAEL] What'cha talking about?  Okay, I know what's going on. You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having s*x, what it looks like, I know, I think---
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey.
[MICHAEL] Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems. Why would I have monkey problems?
[MICHAEL] Oh, I hate monkeys.
[MICHAEL] I don't have a second job. Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
[MICHAEL] I don't talk to my girlfriend about money. It is rude, and unsexual.
[MICHAEL] I totally agree with you. But I don't have money problems, I don't. Alright, you know what? Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
[MICHAEL] No you didn't.
[MICHAEL] That is a good point.
[MICHAEL] Like the witness protection program.
[MICHAEL] I didn't say it, I declared it.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, tell me about it.
[MICHAEL] You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
[MICHAEL] Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
[MICHAEL] That is by far the best way to strengthen your core. This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist. It strengthens your entire core. Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it. I think that's how they got a core.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hm. That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
[MICHAEL] Right.
[MICHAEL] How do they do this so fast? Is this power-point?
[MICHAEL] No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
[MICHAEL] We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
[MICHAEL] You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
[MICHAEL] No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half.
[MICHAEL] She poses.
[MICHAEL] Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?
[MICHAEL] Hey Jan.
[MICHAEL] Not much, what's up with you?
[MICHAEL] I'm out of answers Jan.
[MICHAEL] I told you, no more answers. This is who I am now. A guy on a train with no answers. I hope that can be enough for you.
[MICHAEL] I don't know that.
[MICHAEL] I'll stay off the grid.
[MICHAEL] Yeah it is, it is. I really messed up.
[MICHAEL] That's really nice of you to say.
[MICHAEL] I think the engineer left.
[MICHAEL] That's nice though.
[MICHAEL] It looks cute though.
[MICHAEL] Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
[MICHAEL] Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
[MICHAEL] Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
[MICHAEL] Michael Scott.
[MICHAEL] Regional manager.
[MICHAEL] Excited to talk ideas.
[MICHAEL] You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.
[MICHAEL] He gives the best back rubs in the office.
[MICHAEL] Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
[MICHAEL] Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima.
[MICHAEL] Who else?
[MICHAEL] Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I know.
[MICHAEL] Mmm. Okay.
[MICHAEL] Well we can do better than that.
[MICHAEL] The waving?
[MICHAEL] Shrek! Shrek, I'm a donkey! I'm a donkey, Shrek!  I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry.
[MICHAEL] Okay, calm down. I have a small problem.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
[MICHAEL] I'm creative, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
[MICHAEL] Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
[MICHAEL] How about never hundred hours, sir.
[MICHAEL] Hey thanks. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
[MICHAEL] What's up my brotha? Listen, David, I would like to do this ad in house. I want to use only the creativity that we have right here in the office. And I will send it to you tomorrow morning, take a look at it, and if you do not think that it's ready to air, send the ad agency back down here, and we'll do it on my dime.
[MICHAEL] I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.
[MICHAEL] Okay.  And thus, Michael Scott sealed his own destiny. In a good way.
[MICHAEL] Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with.
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
[MICHAEL] Line it up Phyllis.
[MICHAEL] Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
[MICHAEL] Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix.
[MICHAEL] Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
[MICHAEL] No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible.
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
[MICHAEL] No. I said I hate the, the style.
[MICHAEL] Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
[MICHAEL] Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
[MICHAEL] That'a girl.
[MICHAEL] Did you, or did you not get Sue Grafton?
[MICHAEL] Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
[MICHAEL] Pam, please clear my phone lines.
[MICHAEL] They could call at any second now.  Oh God...I better call.
[MICHAEL] No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
[MICHAEL] That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
[MICHAEL] This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off. We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door. When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring. Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
[MICHAEL] But, you will not tell anyone.
[MICHAEL] Well, sometimes. Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.  Yes? Oh good, good Stanley! First victim, this is what I want you to do. Go out, come back in. We're going to hide. I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
[MICHAEL] Just go out, and come back in.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Okay, smarty pants, then why? Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
[MICHAEL] That could not possibly be it.
[MICHAEL] Yeah we all want money. But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.
[MICHAEL] Mo money mo problems, Stanley. You of all people should know that. Let me ask you this, if I were-
[MICHAEL] Pssh, kay.
[MICHAEL] Fillipellers, how's it hanging?
[MICHAEL] To the left?
[MICHAEL] To the right?
[MICHAEL] Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
[MICHAEL] Yes, listen, um... You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
[MICHAEL] No, his work family. Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man. You may have Toby.
[MICHAEL] You can train him. He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst. That- that was a bluff, um... Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.
[MICHAEL] Okay, good-bye. Wait! Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please? Your best one?
[MICHAEL] Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
[MICHAEL] I'm going to cut right to the chase here. Do you like magic? Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes. To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
[MICHAEL] Get out.  Uh, yeah. I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.
[MICHAEL] No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
[MICHAEL] Jim, we're getting crapped on. Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
[MICHAEL] What are we going to do? We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do. Corcroan dropped Staples.
[MICHAEL] Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it. You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale. We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
[MICHAEL] That's the problem, that's the problem. We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll. Alright?  Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving. I- I have no words.
[MICHAEL] What? What? We did?
[MICHAEL] Look at his face! Look at his face!
[MICHAEL] What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
[MICHAEL] We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.
[MICHAEL] Uh-huh.
[MICHAEL] Yes you are. Oh, buckle up Jim.
[MICHAEL] We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.
[MICHAEL] In your face
[MICHAEL] Are you calling Karen?
[MICHAEL] Yep, get it.
[MICHAEL] It had to be done, it had to be done.
[MICHAEL] Hey Dwight, he found it.
[MICHAEL] Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
[MICHAEL] Do you really wanna know?
[MICHAEL] Follow me, come here. Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse. I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
[MICHAEL] No, no, not real bombs.
[MICHAEL] Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
[MICHAEL] It could be badass. Yeah, it will.
[MICHAEL] Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
[MICHAEL] I can't imagine the s*x being bad, I mean her body is...
[MICHAEL] ...awesome.
[MICHAEL] Okay, I will start. Um, "A."  "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell... Damn it! What do we sell? Um...
[MICHAEL] I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
[MICHAEL] Ah, la, la, la. What is that? That sound... The air-conditioning leaking or something?
[MICHAEL] What is that? Dwight, are you peeing?
[MICHAEL] Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
[MICHAEL] I'll kill you man!
[MICHAEL] That is just so disgusting!
[MICHAEL] Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down. You and I-
[MICHAEL] You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers. And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
[MICHAEL] There's a guy, there's a guy.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
[MICHAEL] We found something far better, their crown jewel. Their industrial copier.
[MICHAEL] It's enormous, but it's got wheels. We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell. Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
[MICHAEL] Aha!
[MICHAEL] We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg! Jim leave us.
[MICHAEL] Save yourself!
[MICHAEL] Dwight, you gotta move!
[MICHAEL] Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
[MICHAEL] Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
[MICHAEL] Just say you wanna get back together.
[MICHAEL] It doesn't have to mean anything. Just, do it for Stanley. Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley. Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
[MICHAEL] Dwight. Granted, maybe this was not the best idea, but at least we care enough about our employees that we are willing to fight for them. And if you so much as harm a hair on Stanley's head, we will burn Utica to the ground.
[MICHAEL] Of course.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Morning.
[MICHAEL] Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
[MICHAEL] So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go?
[MICHAEL] Oh, you wanna go today?
[MICHAEL] How often can you actually donate blood?
[MICHAEL] Your body only has a certain amount.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame.
[MICHAEL] A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores?
[MICHAEL] Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
[MICHAEL] In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
[MICHAEL] I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
[MICHAEL] I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
[MICHAEL] OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.  Hey, what...
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
[MICHAEL] Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours.
[MICHAEL] Yes, and I am leaving you in charge of the office for the rest of the day and for the next several days. Do not try to follow me.
[MICHAEL] This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I.
[MICHAEL] When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
[MICHAEL] Well, yes I would. And I would survive.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] You...
[MICHAEL] You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.  OK.
[MICHAEL] I am putting this on so I have no familiarity with my surroundings. Now this way, I can't retrace my steps. I don't know what streets we've been---  Ow! What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] No! Gosh! Dwight.  Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
[MICHAEL] Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
[MICHAEL] Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out.
[MICHAEL] What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
[MICHAEL] Stop.
[MICHAEL] Alright, good. Thank you, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Alright, very good. Ahh, OK.
[MICHAEL] Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Yeah!  Alright, skip around the room. Skip around the room. We want -- OK, alright. Yeah, don't do that. You're gonna break something.
[MICHAEL] What up?
[MICHAEL] You are relieved.
[MICHAEL] So what did I miss?
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake.
[MICHAEL] Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
[MICHAEL] That's what I said. That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
[MICHAEL] Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
[MICHAEL] I'll call back.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
[MICHAEL] N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
[MICHAEL] I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
[MICHAEL] Uh, okay, all right. Pam, would you put the call through?  Hi buddy.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I hate that.
[MICHAEL] So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
[MICHAEL] Yes, yes. Pat-tern. Patt-ern. My friend Pat took a turn. That's how I remember that. Could we pull over and put down the top? I'm feeling a little queasy.
[MICHAEL] Well-
[MICHAEL] Disray .My friend Disray got news specs. Disray spect. My friend Inappro drives a Prius with his behind neighbor.
[MICHAEL] Yep. Tell them how much you're gonna get if you win.
[MICHAEL] Million dollars!
[MICHAEL] Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
[MICHAEL] Perfect crime.
[MICHAEL] Could we please pull over and pull down the top, I do not feel good.
[MICHAEL] I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
[MICHAEL] Hey hey.
[MICHAEL] I would love that.
[MICHAEL] Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company.
[MICHAEL] It is.
[MICHAEL] Hi.  No, no, absolutely not. What is he doing here?
[MICHAEL] Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
[MICHAEL] Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
[MICHAEL] Okay. All right.
[MICHAEL] Yessh.
[MICHAEL] Well, it was not just termination. It was a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behavior.
[MICHAEL] I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican Brief
[MICHAEL] Six years and two months.
[MICHAEL] That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] Uh, wh-why would she say that?
[MICHAEL] Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
[MICHAEL] Well, delivery is all wrong. She's butchering it.
[MICHAEL] She thought it had to do with the twins. That's what I call them.
[MICHAEL] Um, to be delicate, they hang off milady's chest. They... make milk.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant.
[MICHAEL] Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
[MICHAEL] Because before we started dating, we disclosed our relationship to HR. And I have the proof right here.
[MICHAEL] I will allow it.
[MICHAEL] Uh...
[MICHAEL] Uh-huh.
[MICHAEL] Ugh. Well, de-depends on how you define "begin". I mean, if it was from the first time we shook hands, that's like six years ago. If it's from the first time we kissed, that's like two years ago.
[MICHAEL] If it was the first time we kissed sober, it was like four months after that.
[MICHAEL] Line.
[MICHAEL] Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
[MICHAEL] Irie.
[MICHAEL] I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.
[MICHAEL] How'd you even find it?
[MICHAEL] I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
[MICHAEL] Fine. I love you.
[MICHAEL] Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
[MICHAEL] Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had s*x with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.
[MICHAEL] Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.
[MICHAEL] That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water.
[MICHAEL] March 17th.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] "I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."
[MICHAEL] Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
[MICHAEL] See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
[MICHAEL] ...Absolutely not.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey no biggie. Just...
[MICHAEL] Hey, David?
[MICHAEL] I think you're a nice guy too.
[MICHAEL] Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
[MICHAEL] Do you fast food?
[MICHAEL] Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
[MICHAEL] Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad!  This is Michael Scott, Scranton, well we don't want to work. No we don't! It's not fair to these people. These people are my friends and I care about them! We're not going to do it!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
[MICHAEL] All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
[MICHAEL] I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
[MICHAEL] You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
[MICHAEL] Hello.
[MICHAEL] Come on in. Good to see you.
[MICHAEL] Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
[MICHAEL] Except driving.
[MICHAEL] Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Totally your call babe.
[MICHAEL] Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
[MICHAEL] Well, thats...
[MICHAEL] Yep, never been used.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] This is it, check that out, can you smell that?
[MICHAEL] As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
[MICHAEL] Bond.
[MICHAEL] James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.
[MICHAEL] Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
[MICHAEL] Well, I-
[MICHAEL] Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
[MICHAEL] It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
[MICHAEL] Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
[MICHAEL] No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
[MICHAEL] If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
[MICHAEL] Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
[MICHAEL] I'll get it.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Very nice.
[MICHAEL] When in Rome.
[MICHAEL] Whatever you say babe.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
[MICHAEL] Yeah that sounds good.
[MICHAEL] You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
[MICHAEL] All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
[MICHAEL] And he was laughing.
[MICHAEL] Look at him, he's laughing.
[MICHAEL] Well you don't need two of you to do that.
[MICHAEL] That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
[MICHAEL] All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
[MICHAEL] All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
[MICHAEL] No, Baah! But he's married to her!
[MICHAEL] No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
[MICHAEL] Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] God, does anybody read the paper?!
[MICHAEL] You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] I don't like that story babe.
[MICHAEL] Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
[MICHAEL] Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry.  What now?
[MICHAEL] Dwight is my friend.
[MICHAEL] You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
[MICHAEL] Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
[MICHAEL] When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
[MICHAEL] Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
[MICHAEL] Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
[MICHAEL] I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.
[MICHAEL] You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
[MICHAEL] Excuse me for a second.
[MICHAEL] Ok... alright... here we go.  There.  Oooookay.
[MICHAEL] Everybody enjoying their meal?
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
[MICHAEL] Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
[MICHAEL] BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
[MICHAEL] NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
[MICHAEL] MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
[MICHAEL] OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
[MICHAEL] THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID!  THAT IS A 200 DOLLAR PLASMA SCREEN TV YOU JUST KILLED! Good luck paying me back on your zero dollars a year salary plus benefits, babe!
[MICHAEL] You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
[MICHAEL] Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.
[MICHAEL] Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.
[MICHAEL] Would she get into trouble?
[MICHAEL] I will take the fall. I did it.
[MICHAEL] Jim? Pam?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Nope.
[MICHAEL] Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair.
[MICHAEL] Hmm...
[MICHAEL] Look at her smile. Those eyes, look at her eyes. She's got - I don't know what it is actually, she dresses like a professional and yet you know there is a side of her that could just curl up on a couch.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah, maybe, but remember after my dinner party when I said that I was swearing off women?
[MICHAEL] I think what I meant was that I was completely swearing off one woman.  Jan. I think that fate put this catalog in my hands.
[MICHAEL] I thought that you were engaged?
[MICHAEL] Whaaaat? God, that's terrible man. Eghh, she's crazy. Umm, are you still on good terms with any of her friends?
[MICHAEL] Oh...
[MICHAEL] Yeah... ugh. She's...  you don't deserve her. Alright.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer?
[MICHAEL] Oooo. Catcher or in field?
[MICHAEL] Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
[MICHAEL] I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?  It bothers me that you're not answering the question.
[MICHAEL] Damn it, I knew it! I knew it Phyllis! OK!
[MICHAEL] Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired.
[MICHAEL] Hmm..
[MICHAEL] Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.  OK, yes that would be bad.
[MICHAEL] That would be bad.
[MICHAEL] Wish I could, but I can't. Well can, but won't. Should, maybe, but shorn't.
[MICHAEL] What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves.
[MICHAEL] Oh you can't because I don't care. Listen,  don't forget to fill out those cards. My love cards.
[MICHAEL] Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael.
[MICHAEL] Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?
[MICHAEL] Damn it Kevin. OK, umm, could I just have a frosty and a baked potato please?
[MICHAEL] Well, I'll send somebody to come pick it up. Just have it ready.
[MICHAEL] Well put it aside.   Umm... yeah.
[MICHAEL] Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
[MICHAEL] That sounds good.  Go get her. Wa-Wait, wait, wait, wait. First, go to Wendy's, get my food. Come back and then go.
[MICHAEL] Oh, God. Oh...
[MICHAEL] Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
[MICHAEL] Please, not at a time like this.
[MICHAEL] Oh really? What's her name? Burger King?
[MICHAEL] I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?
[MICHAEL] No, not the five families.
[MICHAEL] Ugh.
[MICHAEL] Is who a Michael what?
[MICHAEL] Oh, that's not, yeah I'm not... OK...
[MICHAEL] Just making conversation.
[MICHAEL] You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind.  Look at that.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Yeah, and you can't see her whole body. Down here, she's got a boob job. Just... she was just crazy smart and really manipulative and I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK. Well, umm... I enjoyed this conversation. It was very nice. It was like talking to the sweet old lady on the bus.
[MICHAEL] Now you ruined it.
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK, Well I'm looking for a passionate affair, not companionship. I'm a man... of intensity, of, of cool and youth and, and passionately. God...
[MICHAEL] You're right. What do you mean though?
[MICHAEL] Hmm.
[MICHAEL] God.
[MICHAEL] She was so innocent.
[MICHAEL] You know I used to think that I had this perfect person out there waiting for me, but knowing that, that's just silly because she's dead. What do you do?
[MICHAEL] Oh, you move on.
[MICHAEL] Return.
[MICHAEL] This'll be  the day that I died.
[MICHAEL] I got gum in my hair.
[MICHAEL] This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
[MICHAEL] OK, let me be.
[MICHAEL] I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
[MICHAEL] Kill me... right now.
[MICHAEL] I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.
[MICHAEL] Oh don't. That's disgusting.
[MICHAEL] Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
[MICHAEL] Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad.
[MICHAEL] Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
[MICHAEL] Na?
[MICHAEL] Well you tried.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] They sound great.
[MICHAEL] Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
[MICHAEL] Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...
[MICHAEL] Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
[MICHAEL] Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
[MICHAEL] Who you dating?
[MICHAEL] That's still going on?
[MICHAEL] Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
[MICHAEL] I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
[MICHAEL] That's... I, I think that...
[MICHAEL] Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
[MICHAEL] No, they're just hotties.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Hey!
[MICHAEL] Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
[MICHAEL] Alright!
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Well.
[MICHAEL] Alright!
[MICHAEL] Let's do it!
[MICHAEL] Hey, nice to meet you.
[MICHAEL] Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
[MICHAEL] Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
[MICHAEL] Back to the Future?  Oh, wow. Well you should take a, a film education course.
[MICHAEL] Forty... I'm in my forties.
[MICHAEL] Nuhh...
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK.
[MICHAEL] You are welcome.
[MICHAEL] Ahh, wow. That's dangerous.
[MICHAEL] You're kidding.
[MICHAEL] I am a bank teller.
[MICHAEL] I think so.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I have fun.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Very perfect.  Oh my  This needs to be shared.
[MICHAEL] I know. I don't wanna get ahead of myself, but I think I want her to meet my mom.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, maybe.
[MICHAEL] Hmm...
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Pretty weird.
[MICHAEL] Let's go.
[MICHAEL] I know, here we go.
[MICHAEL] This is it.
[MICHAEL] This is where the magic happens.
[MICHAEL] Very nice.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, I'm the boss.
[MICHAEL] Case anyone needs to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I don't wannna get my head stepped on.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, shh shh. Dwight. Leave him alone.
[MICHAEL] Shh. Ryan, Ryan, we're going to take your clothes off.
[MICHAEL] Shh, just stop. Here's what you do. You tell him that you're his friend and that you're gonna help him and that everyone's gonna be all right. And then you put a wire on him and you find out who's selling him drugs and then you get that guy and you flip up, turn him into a snitch. You follow that guy to the people who's really really bad. Been watching The Wire recently. I don't understand a word of it.
[MICHAEL] Best night ever.
[MICHAEL] Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
[MICHAEL] M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
[MICHAEL] Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
[MICHAEL] Here we go!
[MICHAEL] Let's, yes?
[MICHAEL] Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!
[MICHAEL] It's drying, it's drying...
[MICHAEL] Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
[MICHAEL] Ahh come on!
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] No!! Come on, gimme something good!
[MICHAEL] Pam, translate.
[MICHAEL] I love it!
[MICHAEL] I love it more!
[MICHAEL] I... love it!! Haha, come on!
[MICHAEL] Hurry, please.
[MICHAEL] That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
[MICHAEL] Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
[MICHAEL] Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
[MICHAEL] Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
[MICHAEL] An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
[MICHAEL] Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
[MICHAEL] Stanley, we're havin a little...
[MICHAEL] We're havin a little brainstorm session...
[MICHAEL] ...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.
[MICHAEL] Ugh, what?
[MICHAEL] What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
[MICHAEL] That? In the conference room?
[MICHAEL] We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright?
[MICHAEL] Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one another: "Hey um, you're poor." "Well hey, you're mama's dead." That's what friends do. It's... you're so white.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm.
[MICHAEL] Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
[MICHAEL] Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
[MICHAEL] I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
[MICHAEL] Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
[MICHAEL] Uh huh...
[MICHAEL] Great
[MICHAEL] What's the pink?
[MICHAEL] Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
[MICHAEL] Other than me.
[MICHAEL] I never said you could do that.
[MICHAEL] I...
[MICHAEL] Okay, I will think about it.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
[MICHAEL] It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
[MICHAEL] I know, it's very, very personal...
[MICHAEL] I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
[MICHAEL] God.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay, so dig this: you're on the street, and one of your gang disses you.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
[MICHAEL] What is that?
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
[MICHAEL] It's like a mock execution.
[MICHAEL] Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
[MICHAEL] No, okay... I've had enough of you.
[MICHAEL] Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
[MICHAEL] I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
[MICHAEL] I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
[MICHAEL] Hmm.
[MICHAEL] Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
[MICHAEL] That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
[MICHAEL] Okay...
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] That's not-
[MICHAEL] All right, all right...
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
[MICHAEL] Everybody, except Stanley.
[MICHAEL] You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.
[MICHAEL] Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
[MICHAEL] All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
[MICHAEL] Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I'm pretty excited too.
[MICHAEL] Yup.
[MICHAEL] Why are you dressed like that?
[MICHAEL] Like you're applying for a loan.
[MICHAEL] Okay, here's what we're going to do: I'm going to instruct the kids about management and sales. Oscar will be in charge of accounting. Pam will be eye candy. No... uh, also, because that is your alma mater. Darryl will hire some kids for the warehouse. We don't have to worry about internships with them, because they definitely ain't going to college.
[MICHAEL] Let's go!
[MICHAEL] This is all we need.
[MICHAEL] Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business!  Hello!
[MICHAEL] Hello. Hi.  Can I talk to you for a sec? Excuse me.
[MICHAEL] Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest."
[MICHAEL] He's totally wrong, Pam.  Hey.
[MICHAEL] How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no problem.  And he signed! He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
[MICHAEL] Are you mental?
[MICHAEL] I... don't.
[MICHAEL] And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
[MICHAEL] Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company...
[MICHAEL] Dammit, Oscar!
[MICHAEL] Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
[MICHAEL] This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
[MICHAEL] Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
[MICHAEL] Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
[MICHAEL] Just-in case. What's your last name?
[MICHAEL] This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
[MICHAEL] This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you.  No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
[MICHAEL] Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
[MICHAEL] So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
[MICHAEL] No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.
[MICHAEL] I, uh, hmm.
[MICHAEL] Why don't... hey.
[MICHAEL] Hold down the fort, I have to do something.  Excuse me. If you can hear me, I'd like you to look around at all these companies and know that none of them are good enough for you. H&R Block? Come on, I mean I don't even know what they do. Frank Regan Funeral Home? Too much formaldehyde! The Air Force?  Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they, well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin? We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
[MICHAEL] Mornin'.  So here we go, just a matter of hours now, until his horribleness has left the building. I'm going to set my watch alarm... And...
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
[MICHAEL] If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
[MICHAEL] Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
[MICHAEL] Toga!
[MICHAEL] I thought that you might say that.
[MICHAEL] Phyllis, can you do this?
[MICHAEL] Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
[MICHAEL] Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
[MICHAEL] Why do you hate her?
[MICHAEL] You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
[MICHAEL] Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
[MICHAEL] We need to sell her an elevator pass.
[MICHAEL] Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey, do you still work here?
[MICHAEL] Nah.
[MICHAEL] No. I think I will pass.
[MICHAEL] Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work here: my job is to make the office fun. Your job is to make the office lame. And we have an eternal struggle, you and I. And only one of us can be the winner. Spoiler alert: I'm gonna win.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
[MICHAEL] Y-You can-Michael.
[MICHAEL] Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
[MICHAEL] I bet.
[MICHAEL] I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
[MICHAEL] Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
[MICHAEL] You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] Music...
[MICHAEL] For a CD mix tape...
[MICHAEL] For Holly.
[MICHAEL] And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
[MICHAEL] The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"...
[MICHAEL] And "I... love you."
[MICHAEL] Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
[MICHAEL] I think I do.
[MICHAEL] Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
[MICHAEL] Well, you're not a romantic.
[MICHAEL] Oh really?
[MICHAEL] Like, with who?
[MICHAEL] Pam?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, you took it too slow.
[MICHAEL] This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
[MICHAEL] I don't want her to get away.
[MICHAEL] Hello, Holly.  Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
[MICHAEL] And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you,  how you sit like that.
[MICHAEL] Sit on floor and put together chair we will.  Yo-da. Um...
[MICHAEL] So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
[MICHAEL] Kidding.  Acting!
[MICHAEL] Acting!
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
[MICHAEL] It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
[MICHAEL] Whew, oh God.  Laying a base. Laying a base...
[MICHAEL] Yeah...
[MICHAEL] Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
[MICHAEL] Yes we do.
[MICHAEL] Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
[MICHAEL] Hey! Hi, good to see you.
[MICHAEL] I'm just having a little exit interview.
[MICHAEL] Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed.  I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
[MICHAEL] Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.  What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
[MICHAEL] Well, no no no no no...
[MICHAEL] No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
[MICHAEL] I'll kill you.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
[MICHAEL] What the hell is that?
[MICHAEL] That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting.  Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
[MICHAEL] My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
[MICHAEL] I am going to give Toby...
[MICHAEL] ...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
[MICHAEL] How did you know?
[MICHAEL] Well... That's my watch.
[MICHAEL] Hey, that's good.
[MICHAEL] I'm just worried about my friend.
[MICHAEL] Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
[MICHAEL] I'm cool.
[MICHAEL] No antigravity machine, huh?
[MICHAEL] Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
[MICHAEL] That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
[MICHAEL] Thanks.
[MICHAEL] I like, uh...
[MICHAEL] Hey. What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] What the hell is going on here?!
[MICHAEL] There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
[MICHAEL] Why did you do that?
[MICHAEL] No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.  Take care of that, all right?
[MICHAEL] Shh...
[MICHAEL] Yeah...
[MICHAEL] Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?  But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
[MICHAEL] I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven."
[MICHAEL] Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart."
[MICHAEL] I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby.  Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp?
[MICHAEL] It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey. Thanks.
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual.  Sorry. Kevin.  Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
[MICHAEL] Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
[MICHAEL] What is it?
[MICHAEL] Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right?  No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
[MICHAEL] O-kay. Hello Jan.
[MICHAEL] Wow, Kevin, really? We're-  Sorry. We're in the middle of a party.  Is this why you called me down here?
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay.
[MICHAEL] Thanks, Kevin. Um...
[MICHAEL] Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
[MICHAEL] Good. Good. Thank God.
[MICHAEL] Cause that's...
[MICHAEL] Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
[MICHAEL] Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
[MICHAEL] ... proud.
[MICHAEL] Um...
[MICHAEL] You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
[MICHAEL] Well, okay...
[MICHAEL] So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
[MICHAEL] You did?
[MICHAEL] When we were going out?
[MICHAEL] W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
[MICHAEL] You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
[MICHAEL] IHop.
[MICHAEL] I'm glad you told me.
[MICHAEL] Um, I'll... I have to think about it.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow.
[MICHAEL] Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar.  Oh...
[MICHAEL] Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
[MICHAEL] Have a good night.
[MICHAEL] Bye.
[MICHAEL] Sorry. Corporate policy.
[MICHAEL] You might take something.
[MICHAEL] Okay, security guard.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, Dwight!
[MICHAEL] No, I will ex-squeeze you.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
[MICHAEL] Did you see Holly's butt?
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times.
[MICHAEL] And that her butt refuses to quit!
[MICHAEL] You have to agree with me.  That's insane.
[MICHAEL] I thought you had to pee.
[MICHAEL] I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
[MICHAEL] No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls."
[MICHAEL] I took a lot from other poems.
[MICHAEL] All right, call--
[MICHAEL] Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] All right!
[MICHAEL] No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello.  Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
[MICHAEL] Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
[MICHAEL] Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
[MICHAEL] Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
[MICHAEL] Damn it. Come on.
[MICHAEL] Here we go. Everybody on.
[MICHAEL] Good.
[MICHAEL] Cake? Who suggested cake?
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
[MICHAEL] Yes, all right. Who else?  Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
[MICHAEL] If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
[MICHAEL] This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
[MICHAEL] Booty call.
[MICHAEL] Here.
[MICHAEL] Wait a second.  I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
[MICHAEL] You want more?
[MICHAEL] You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
[MICHAEL] Let's go mini-golfing.
[MICHAEL] Uh...
[MICHAEL] Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
[MICHAEL] You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Good luck.
[MICHAEL] OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
[MICHAEL] And what is that?
[MICHAEL] You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
[MICHAEL] I did!
[MICHAEL] Yes. Gooooo-tee!
[MICHAEL] Hey, you know what? I can't do this by myself people! Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.
[MICHAEL] Mmm--- mmm... Um...
[MICHAEL] Your stupid friend zone.
[MICHAEL] I should have been lovers with her first and then friends. That was terrible advice. Terrible advice! You know my seduction method. I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh--- You sabotaged me. You sabotaged me, man!
[MICHAEL] Mmm-hmm. Saunas.
[MICHAEL] Gah, the dreadmill.
[MICHAEL] Ohhhh! Bang! Boom! Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
[MICHAEL] I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful.  They are beautiful. He is beautiful. This big fat pig is beautiful.
[MICHAEL] If it's me, then society made me that way. Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"
[MICHAEL] How do you know Michael Clump?
[MICHAEL] How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, NO, no! You know what? Fat people are not monsters! Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject. Bang! Boom! Case in point! Look at the outside of this building. It is ugly. But you come inside... and it is beautiful. Just like this unappealing fat suit. Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
[MICHAEL] Hey! Why don't you just sit down, please?
[MICHAEL] We're doing this because of you. So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.  Hey. Hey. You shaved?
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
[MICHAEL] You're right, you're right. Just, Dwight, do it. Just say it ok.
[MICHAEL] Finally. Right? Ok, Phyllis you must be exhausted from standing on those gams. Why don't you have a seat?  Let's all clap at Phyllis.  Ok!  When Michael Clump wants to remind you  that corporate... their idea, yes, was to urge you to lose weight, but more importantly what this whole thing is about, this contest is really about being healthy. And in order to be healthy, you have to eat, Kelly. Kelly.  Kelly, I want you to stand up on your chair. Come on, stand up on your chair. Stand up, stand up, stand up. Somebody help her. Here we go.  Ok, I want you to look at her. She's a beautiful Indian woman. Why? What makes her beautiful?
[MICHAEL] Ok, be more specific.
[MICHAEL] What about her looks?
[MICHAEL] I want you to know. Kelly, look at me! I want you to know that you are beautiful. You are truly, truly beautiful. Give me a hug.  Mmmmmm.
[MICHAEL] Ahaha, Yep!
[MICHAEL] Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
[MICHAEL] Hey!
[MICHAEL] Excellent! Good job.
[MICHAEL] No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy. What, what happened? Did he call?
[MICHAEL] I dunno. I always call everybody back right away. He'll call back though. Give him until the end of the day, he'll call. If he doesn't, he is loco.
[MICHAEL] Ugh.
[MICHAEL] Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
[MICHAEL] We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly. Please?
[MICHAEL] Ok, that is fine. Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
[MICHAEL] Aww, really?
[MICHAEL] I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
[MICHAEL] ...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
[MICHAEL] I know. I love Counting Crows.
[MICHAEL] Wow, really?
[MICHAEL] That's a shame. A shame to waste these. I want to buy them from you.
[MICHAEL] I do. No. I do. I, I want to. Trust me. I really do.
[MICHAEL] Ok?
[MICHAEL] Alright. Alright!  Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok? Case closed. Umm, can I pay you tomorrow? I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
[MICHAEL] Is that good?
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Darryl, would you do the honors?
[MICHAEL] Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning. This is a good day. You guys accomplished something big. You lost a ton of weight, literally. A lot of weight. And I don't care what any stupid scale says. You guys are all gigantic losers.
[MICHAEL] What's going on?
[MICHAEL] To be married?
[MICHAEL] WOO! Alright!
[MICHAEL] Ok. Well done. Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
[MICHAEL] Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.
[MICHAEL] Can't set 'em up like that.
[MICHAEL] Can we have a moment?  Can I talk to you for a sec? Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Do some... do some work.  People expect a lot from these meetings. Laughter, sudden twists. Surprise endings. You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan. You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
[MICHAEL] Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
[MICHAEL] Lauren,  enough with the pencils.
[MICHAEL] I would not... steal the bread. And I would not let my family go hungry.
[MICHAEL] Anybody? This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions. Stanley? Oscar, come on.
[MICHAEL] I will go first. When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days. I did nothing. I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.
[MICHAEL] To tell you or not. And I'm glad I did. I feel very very good. Cathartic. I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble. You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, . Come on, anybody. Let it fly.
[MICHAEL] A siesta!
[MICHAEL] You are a thief of joy. Anybody else. Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Who hasn't? Good. Good! What else?
[MICHAEL] Mmm...
[MICHAEL] Well, let's keep this party movin' on.
[MICHAEL] Bruuuuuuuuuce.
[MICHAEL] Ach! Wuh---
[MICHAEL] That's crazy. That's crazy talk! Meredith! The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers! Hoo-ooh! Wow! What time we got?  You know what? That's a good place to end it. Right there. This, I think, was a great ethics seminar. She has given us a lot of wonderful things to think about. Right... what is wrong. Who's to say? Really. In the end. I mean because it is... unknowable. But, let's give her a round of applause. Holly, everybody. Holly! Get back to work.   Great job. I am truly impressed. That, uh, you really pulled that one out. Classic. Classic meeting. We should celebrate.
[MICHAEL] Oh...
[MICHAEL] Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks. Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
[MICHAEL] No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
[MICHAEL] Well, well. Holly... lujah! It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
[MICHAEL] Hoo-ooh! Reaching! You'll get there. Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out.
[MICHAEL] Good. Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
[MICHAEL] Oh no, no, no. Your food is no good here, my lady.  Sorry! You know what? Let's go out! Dunder Mifflin's treat. Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it? Ethical.
[MICHAEL] What do you think? What do you think of this place?
[MICHAEL] Istn't it? Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic. So you're from Des Moines?
[MICHAEL] Wow, that sounds so... warm.
[MICHAEL] Here too. You know what my favorite season is?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way. Autumn was what I was going to say. When the leaves change. It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
[MICHAEL] Wow, terminator, terminator.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Ok, new idea. We don't report it at all. We just punish her.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm, tell her she can't have s*x for six months.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
[MICHAEL] No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal. You know what I am talking about. You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Well... bleh busted. I don't...
[MICHAEL] Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
[MICHAEL] What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
[MICHAEL] You get me.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. Can you? Kendall, my main man.
[MICHAEL] Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
[MICHAEL] Ok, everybody listen up. If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
[MICHAEL] Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it!
[MICHAEL] Now is really not the time, Meredith.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] OK, just remember to keep breathing.
[MICHAEL] OK, good.
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK! OK!
[MICHAEL] I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
[MICHAEL] I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
[MICHAEL] I checked the route - there are no potholes. Come on, get in here and have the baby.
[MICHAEL] Andy, would you like to have my baby?
[MICHAEL] All right, OK.  Sorry. Sorry. Here we go. Here we go!
[MICHAEL] Do it! Do it! Scream! Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
[MICHAEL] Aaaaaaaa!
[MICHAEL] I'm right here.
[MICHAEL] I'm right here, I'm right here.
[MICHAEL] All right. Dwight. Just push and breathe.
[MICHAEL] Shhh. No, you can't have it. It's too late.
[MICHAEL] No. You have to just push it out!
[MICHAEL] Keep simulating.
[MICHAEL] OK!
[MICHAEL] Keep simulating.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I do!
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Aaaaaaaa! It's coming! Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
[MICHAEL] Nice touch. Good. Let's try that again.
[MICHAEL] Damnit, Phyllis! I'm sorry.  Damnit, Phyllis. It was hard enough to convince Jan to come. So are we set for refreshments?
[MICHAEL] She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
[MICHAEL] I know. I know. It is beautiful. No. Thank you. Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons? You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up. I think you need to get the lead out. Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here. We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower. Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey. What are you doing? Don't talk to them.
[MICHAEL] Make the party. Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!
[MICHAEL] Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
[MICHAEL] Um, listen. Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest. It's all kind of weird. Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive. And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office. So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you. And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings. And I'm treating Ryan the same way.
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK. Why didn't you call me?
[MICHAEL] I could have helped.
[MICHAEL] Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
[MICHAEL] No, I don't!
[MICHAEL] Can I hold her?
[MICHAEL] All right, OK.
[MICHAEL] ...trid Levinson. Hi! Astrid, this is everybody, look. This is your family. You're going to know them for the rest of your life.
[MICHAEL] Well, he may not be here. Say hello! OK, here we go.  Lion King!
[MICHAEL] OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
[MICHAEL] I'm fine, weirdo. Such an HR weirdo. Try not to suck all the air out of there when you walk in.
[MICHAEL] Uh, duh.
[MICHAEL] No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK? The baby multiplies the fun. Let's just do what you were going to do.
[MICHAEL] All right, how about some presents? I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
[MICHAEL] Whatta we got?
[MICHAEL] Oh!
[MICHAEL] She already has a stroller.
[MICHAEL] OK, what else?
[MICHAEL] Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No. No. This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
[MICHAEL] Uh, yeah.
[MICHAEL] I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
[MICHAEL] Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I a baby daddy. Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby? Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
[MICHAEL] I just saw this baby daddy-
[MICHAEL] Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?
[MICHAEL] Well-
[MICHAEL] It's- that's different.
[MICHAEL] That's not a baby.
[MICHAEL] Could I?
[MICHAEL] I was just going to... I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene. She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
[MICHAEL] All right. All right, everybody, we're leaving. Jan and Astrid are leaving.
[MICHAEL] OK?
[MICHAEL] Wha - that's, I hate her. Wha - God! Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] You wanna go out?
[MICHAEL] Paaam-o-laaaaaa...
[MICHAEL] Paaam-o-laaaaaa... Miss ya kiddo. Miss you... so much.
[MICHAEL] That was really fun last night.
[MICHAEL] I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Oh really?
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] I, uh...  I let her win.
[MICHAEL] So, when, um, can I see you again?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.  Because I am busy taking you out.
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight...
[MICHAEL] Tonight's so...
[MICHAEL] Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Some of what we order depends on whether we're having s*x after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have s*x tonight?
[MICHAEL] Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
[MICHAEL] No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes.   I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
[MICHAEL] Do you need 'em?
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Thank vous.  What? Oh!
[MICHAEL] Not if we turn these dials  all the way down.  Now they can't hear us at all.
[MICHAEL] We're totally alone.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Oh... oh!
[MICHAEL] No, did you?
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, my God.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God!
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
[MICHAEL] I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
[MICHAEL] Do I?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.
[MICHAEL] Whoa!
[MICHAEL] Twice. ... Right?
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
[MICHAEL] Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says "Creed."
[MICHAEL] Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
[MICHAEL] Federal and State.
[MICHAEL] Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
[MICHAEL] Hey!
[MICHAEL] 100 dollars, great.
[MICHAEL] Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.
[MICHAEL] 160
[MICHAEL] Uh, just a few more items.
[MICHAEL] All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item.  All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around?
[MICHAEL] No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
[MICHAEL] She's your wife, you idiot.
[MICHAEL] Uh, what the hell is happening?
[MICHAEL] 300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.

[MICHAEL] Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
[MICHAEL] We're not.
[MICHAEL] We're not doing anything.
[MICHAEL] Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
[MICHAEL] Cool!
[MICHAEL] We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.
[MICHAEL] Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!  Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
[MICHAEL] Was I? Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
[MICHAEL] All right. What's the scoop, how far?
[MICHAEL] Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
[MICHAEL] Allergies?
[MICHAEL] Did Darryl touch you?
[MICHAEL] Sure it is.
[MICHAEL] Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.
[MICHAEL] Listen to me. I like you so much.
[MICHAEL] And I've dated four women in the last--
[MICHAEL] Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
[MICHAEL] I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
[MICHAEL] That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way.
[MICHAEL] I'll tell you everything that I see. Everything that I pass by, things that I witness on the road.
[MICHAEL] Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
[MICHAEL] Years!
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
[MICHAEL] My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.
[MICHAEL] Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this.
[MICHAEL] I don't know what I'm gonna do!
[MICHAEL] Please?
[MICHAEL] I'm not gonna be okay.
[MICHAEL] No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
[MICHAEL] Oh that's mine actually. Um, maybe put it back in the truck.
[MICHAEL] You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.
[MICHAEL] I'll be down in just a second.  Holly?
[MICHAEL] We didn't break up.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] That's a really pretty song.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Da na na na na.
[MICHAEL] Da na na na na.
[MICHAEL] Da na na na na.
[MICHAEL] Da na na na na.
[MICHAEL] Da na na na na!!
[MICHAEL] Da na na na na.
[MICHAEL] Da na na na na.
[MICHAEL] Da na na na na...
[MICHAEL] Ow! God!
[MICHAEL] No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, so there you go.
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow, so quickly.
[MICHAEL] Nope. Nope. Not yet.
[MICHAEL] I'll call her later.
[MICHAEL] I don't want to do that.  All right.  She is going to freak out!
[MICHAEL] That's -- thanks.
[MICHAEL] Mom, I'm getting married.
[MICHAEL] Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] I'm not, I'm not getting married. So...  Psych.
[MICHAEL] And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
[MICHAEL] I'll take care of that for you.  Thanks.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Wow.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
[MICHAEL] A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no, no.
[MICHAEL] Do I look like I am joking?
[MICHAEL] If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
[MICHAEL] You're not.
[MICHAEL] Jimbo, let's do this thang.
[MICHAEL] You too?
[MICHAEL] Jim, they are a poopy.
[MICHAEL] No.  Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
[MICHAEL] I agree.
[MICHAEL] So let's see what we can find out from reading.  Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
[MICHAEL] Arrogance.
[MICHAEL] And there's our smudgeness.
[MICHAEL] Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
[MICHAEL] Ask him his name.
[MICHAEL] Be respectful, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] It's up to you to change his mind.
[MICHAEL] Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
[MICHAEL] He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
[MICHAEL] Stop it! Stop it!
[MICHAEL] That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
[MICHAEL] Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Give me the phone.
[MICHAEL] Give me the phone.
[MICHAEL] Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
[MICHAEL] Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
[MICHAEL] Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
[MICHAEL] See how it's done?  Thank you very much, sir. I don't think you'll regret it.  See what I did?
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] ...  It's a million-dollar sale.
[MICHAEL] Why don't you tell us?
[MICHAEL] Dwight.  I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
[MICHAEL] What's going on?
[MICHAEL] Kelly.
[MICHAEL] You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
[MICHAEL] Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
[MICHAEL] You were lying.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
[MICHAEL] I will call you when it is time.
[MICHAEL] I think you should do that.
[MICHAEL] I am jetting off on an international business trip.
[MICHAEL] To Can-A-da.
[MICHAEL] Canada.
[MICHAEL] I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket.  You are now sexy in your culture.
[MICHAEL] I have my passport.
[MICHAEL] I have my per diem.  I already know what I am going to spend this on. I am going to buy a sweater.
[MICHAEL] Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
[MICHAEL] Well that is all in the past.
[MICHAEL] They have one of those?
[MICHAEL] Two are for souvenirs.
[MICHAEL] I do. It's right here.
[MICHAEL] No, I don't want to wear a bra.
[MICHAEL] Stop it! Stop it!
[MICHAEL] Okay. Where is my translator?
[MICHAEL] There he is.
[MICHAEL] Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you  if you hadn't forgotten French. Where is my numbers man?
[MICHAEL] There we go. Our town car awaits.
[MICHAEL] Its not just a van.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, can you get those please?
[MICHAEL] Handed to me as I sat down. This was my hot towel. It is still wet.
[MICHAEL] Take a sip of that.
[MICHAEL] That good?
[MICHAEL] Don't drink all of it. Give some to Oscar.
[MICHAEL] You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
[MICHAEL] Yes, this is Beth. This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
[MICHAEL] Yes...
[MICHAEL] Get back, get back. Come on, get back to the slums.
[MICHAEL] Hey... guys, check it out. My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
[MICHAEL] Shhhh! Keep it down.
[MICHAEL] Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?  My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
[MICHAEL] Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
[MICHAEL] Oh... okay.  Doesn't matter, because I am going to take a nap. I think I am going to use my complimentary blindfold. I will don it... and oh! Look at that. I can't see because I am in a--  GAH!
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Very cool.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
[MICHAEL] Wow!
[MICHAEL] Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
[MICHAEL] Let's do this.
[MICHAEL] Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott. Good to see you again.
[MICHAEL] Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
[MICHAEL] Works in accounting. This is uh, concierge Marie...
[MICHAEL] ...who works at our hotel. You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
[MICHAEL] And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---
[MICHAEL] She's foreign. I am--
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you.
[MICHAEL] Thank you, Andy.
[MICHAEL] ---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do? What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
[MICHAEL] Unbelievable! Unbelievable.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Slept like a baby.
[MICHAEL] Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here. They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter. They are treated like human beings.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, we locked him up for two years.
[MICHAEL] No. Actually the trip sucked.
[MICHAEL] The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.
[MICHAEL] I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.
[MICHAEL] And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.
[MICHAEL] It was not, it sucked.
[MICHAEL] Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige. That was great. That was great. That was--- that was a---
[MICHAEL] That was a really good choice.
[MICHAEL] No, David. You listen to me. Why did you send her away? That--- God. You knew I liked her and you just sent her away. And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.
[MICHAEL] That was a really sucky thing to do.
[MICHAEL] Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
[MICHAEL] Yeah why don't you send that to him in Costa Rica?
[MICHAEL] Heh, okay, weirdo.
[MICHAEL] She said she was going to give it to him right now.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, they used to.
[MICHAEL] Oh, can you imagine?
[MICHAEL] Uhhgh.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. What?
[MICHAEL] Hmmm, dare I?  You know what? I'm going to, for old time's sake.  Great practical joke Jim, you got me to go to the annex.
[MICHAEL] NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] He looks worse.
[MICHAEL] Uh, well I'm afraid not. Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.
[MICHAEL] Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
[MICHAEL] That's true. People say it's icky.
[MICHAEL] David, wait.
[MICHAEL] Is there no way we can get rid of him?
[MICHAEL] I have cause. It is be-cause I hate him.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] I don't.
[MICHAEL] Don't do that.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome. Missed you. Missed you as part of our family.
[MICHAEL] So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun? That must have been fun.
[MICHAEL] Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
[MICHAEL] Why'd you come back? Why didn't you stay?
[MICHAEL] I bet, for you.
[MICHAEL] Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I am. I am.
[MICHAEL] That's it, that's it, perfect. We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
[MICHAEL] Mm. Me too. Okay, let's get this started.
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] For what?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no.
[MICHAEL] You're the bait for Toby?
[MICHAEL] No, for one thing, he's not gay. And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim. Or Ryan. Or me.
[MICHAEL] Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah. Hello, Pam. Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
[MICHAEL] Oh, oooh his mistress. No. I'm kidding. No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
[MICHAEL] Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson? I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits. Do not read it beforehand. Can you do that for me?
[MICHAEL] Pam. Pam, you gave me your word.
[MICHAEL] Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
[MICHAEL] Toby can I see those? Ooh.  What's the matter? What's the matter? You scared?
[MICHAEL] You mad? You mad at me?
[MICHAEL] Do you want to do that? You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
[MICHAEL] Huh? He might do it...
[MICHAEL] I dare you to. Come on.
[MICHAEL] What's the matter... haaaww!
[MICHAEL] Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
[MICHAEL] No do it, do it. I dare you.
[MICHAEL] Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch. Come on! Come oooon...
[MICHAEL] Son of a bitch.
[MICHAEL] Just stop it. You haven't done anything helpful all day.
[MICHAEL] What's that?
[MICHAEL] Frame him?
[MICHAEL] I've never framed a man before, have you?
[MICHAEL] Just seems awfully mean. But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
[MICHAEL] No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...
[MICHAEL] Grass, weed?
[MICHAEL] I heard you drug--- I heard you dealt.
[MICHAEL] I'm not wearing a wire, so...
[MICHAEL] How much? How many pounds is it?
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey. Hey. I forgot... I forgot...
[MICHAEL] Uh, you know what? I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?
[MICHAEL] No, no no no... No, no.
[MICHAEL] No, that was... that was legitimate. That was totally legitimate.
[MICHAEL] Oh God!
[MICHAEL] No, no no no no.
[MICHAEL] God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is. And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!
[MICHAEL] Ahh, that's mine.
[MICHAEL] Yes, it's mine.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me? That's my salad.
[MICHAEL] You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
[MICHAEL] Hmm.
[MICHAEL] Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about? You're... you're worried about the cop's time? You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer? Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
[MICHAEL] Yes, you did. And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
[MICHAEL] Do you want to hear a lie?
[MICHAEL] I think you're great. You're my best friend.
[MICHAEL] Mmm... okay.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] There's the x-ax...icks.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm, okay.
[MICHAEL] Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
[MICHAEL] Ho-oh!
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I'll be six.
[MICHAEL] So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
[MICHAEL] Whoo.
[MICHAEL] Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...
[MICHAEL] No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?
[MICHAEL] So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.
[MICHAEL] Alright, so, teams forming.
[MICHAEL] You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Why me?
[MICHAEL] Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
[MICHAEL] Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Ohh, God!
[MICHAEL] Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[MICHAEL] All right! Cool!
[MICHAEL] I have no idea.
[MICHAEL] Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey.
[MICHAEL] I do.
[MICHAEL] it was fun. We had a good time.
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you.
[MICHAEL] Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
[MICHAEL] You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
[MICHAEL] Nine dollars. The boys' department.
[MICHAEL] Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
[MICHAEL] Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.
[MICHAEL] Yes they were.
[MICHAEL] They were.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm.
[MICHAEL] Sits on a copier.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Very valid.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] See ya.
[MICHAEL] Hahaha!... well...
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you my dear.
[MICHAEL] Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
[MICHAEL] There he is! Hello, hello!
[MICHAEL] Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
[MICHAEL] Mm!  Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
[MICHAEL] Oh... ah, I almost choked.
[MICHAEL] Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
[MICHAEL] Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
[MICHAEL] It is, yes.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Oh, there we go.
[MICHAEL] Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
[MICHAEL] So, the copier.
[MICHAEL] All right, yes.
[MICHAEL] Well, what should I do?
[MICHAEL] All right, get out. Get out.
[MICHAEL] Hey David-  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling-  I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
[MICHAEL] The what now?
[MICHAEL] ...Like a tip?  $645?!
[MICHAEL] All right, attention everyone.
[MICHAEL] I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...  working perfectly.
[MICHAEL] Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Hmm. See how relaxed I am? I like this chair.  Offers good support, it is urkelnomically correct... it's a good chair. I think we're spoiled because we don't appreciate the things that we have. You think kids in Africa have chairs? No. They sit in big piles of garbage. You think they have copiers?  They don't have copiers. They don't even-  Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I this: I have seen the light in terms of what we need, and it is nothing.
[MICHAEL] Do I know what?
[MICHAEL] Mm, no...
[MICHAEL] $645.
[MICHAEL] Right.
[MICHAEL] Because that is how my mind works.
[MICHAEL] Let's see...
[MICHAEL] I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
[MICHAEL] This is so stupid.
[MICHAEL] This is so, so stupid. And, God...  that's my phone.
[MICHAEL] To be continued!
[MICHAEL] You think it's easy?
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Good work. I'm proud of you.  Mother-
[MICHAEL] Awesome. I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn? I thought they were all sold out.
[MICHAEL] Cool.  My horn can pierce the sky.
[MICHAEL] Alright... One more time around the block.
[MICHAEL] That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice. I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft teeth
[MICHAEL] No, no. I celebrate privately.
[MICHAEL] Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
[MICHAEL] We'll do it quickly.
[MICHAEL] What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
[MICHAEL] Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
[MICHAEL] Uck... T.M.I.
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
[MICHAEL] I am not asking her to stop drinking. I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.
[MICHAEL] The aye's have it.
[MICHAEL] Alright, well, let's look at this a little bit closer then shall we?
[MICHAEL] Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
[MICHAEL] Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
[MICHAEL] I got it on a website, that's not important.
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what Toby? One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this. I'm doing your job man. Hey, are you texting?
[MICHAEL] Alcohol is a drag. Yes. Here's what I'd like to do. I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us. I'll begin. This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this. That's how your drinking affected me. Anybody else? Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you? Come on people. If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.  Yes, Kevin.
[MICHAEL] That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
[MICHAEL] Okay, no, that's not what we're going for. Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking? It has to bother you. It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you? Dwight, don't you have anything?
[MICHAEL] Was John Belushi fine? Was Bob Hope fine? Hey-- come here. If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
[MICHAEL] I want you to say I'm an alcoholic.
[MICHAEL] You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.
[MICHAEL] Alright, no, no, no. No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting. But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today. What about tomorrow.? What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?
[MICHAEL] Dwight--
[MICHAEL] ...okay.
[MICHAEL] Enabler! Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler. It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
[MICHAEL] We did?
[MICHAEL] Oh, shoot. Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.
[MICHAEL] We could go there, sure.
[MICHAEL] Yes, yes.
[MICHAEL] I have a new place.
[MICHAEL] It-- yep, recently.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, oh there you go.
[MICHAEL] That's good.
[MICHAEL] We're party girls.
[MICHAEL] It's okay. It's all right.
[MICHAEL] Meredith, we are doing this for your own good. Okay. Come on--
[MICHAEL] Here we go. This is gonna be good.
[MICHAEL] Yes you are.
[MICHAEL] Shhh... just calm down.
[MICHAEL] Come on. Shh...
[MICHAEL] Here's the door. Here's the door.
[MICHAEL] Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
[MICHAEL] I have a deposit. Alcoholic.
[MICHAEL] So do I sign?
[MICHAEL] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
[MICHAEL] No. No, no. There was wind.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
[MICHAEL] I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
[MICHAEL] I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
[MICHAEL] Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.
[MICHAEL] Beat it!
[MICHAEL] Wait, you still don't know...
[MICHAEL] You still don't know.
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] Andy.
[MICHAEL] No, what I'm saying is...
[MICHAEL] No, that's not it.
[MICHAEL] I can't take it anymore.
[MICHAEL] I am telling Andy.
[MICHAEL] Who should it come from, then?
[MICHAEL] Are you still having intercourse with her?
[MICHAEL] Did you ever have intercourse in this office?
[MICHAEL] You know this can't go on.
[MICHAEL] We have to put an end to this.
[MICHAEL] Come on.
[MICHAEL] When will she be ready?
[MICHAEL] Is she crazy in bed?
[MICHAEL] How so, specifically?
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] It's too late.
[MICHAEL] I am already walking.
[MICHAEL] Okay, what does that mean?
[MICHAEL] Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
[MICHAEL] Thanks.  Andy?
[MICHAEL] Walk with me.
[MICHAEL] Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
[MICHAEL] Which will be fine. I am off!
[MICHAEL] Thank you!
[MICHAEL] Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
[MICHAEL] Dwight and Angela are having an affair. They've been sleeping together for some time. That was the news. I wanted to let you know.
[MICHAEL] All right. See you later.  Ahh.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] Right what?
[MICHAEL] David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
[MICHAEL] Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you.
[MICHAEL] I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Hi, I am well, how are you?
[MICHAEL] Oh, have you not?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
[MICHAEL] Oh, well, then, email it to me.
[MICHAEL] I will seduce her.
[MICHAEL] No, I will seduce her.
[MICHAEL] No, I got it.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, so what if I did? That would take precedence and I would expect your support.
[MICHAEL] Alright, I am a local business owner.  I need to buy paper. I find out everything about their prices and policies
[MICHAEL] Michael Scarn.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
[MICHAEL] Oh, don't start,
[MICHAEL] You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
[MICHAEL] You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
[MICHAEL] So what?
[MICHAEL] Maybe they are shrinking.
[MICHAEL] They could be shrinking.
[MICHAEL] Ah ha  Yup.
[MICHAEL] Mm hmm .
[MICHAEL] And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
[MICHAEL] Argh, why are you all...
[MICHAEL] Shut up.
[MICHAEL] Ready to do this?
[MICHAEL] Good. Here come the sharks.
[MICHAEL] My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] We are a law firm.
[MICHAEL] You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question  for you would be  how many clients do you have?
[MICHAEL] Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.
[MICHAEL] Ah, so when did you set up shop?
[MICHAEL] Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .
[MICHAEL] Well that is... because... I am a genius.
[MICHAEL] Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?  Is this the cup?  Is this what I drink out of?  Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession.
[MICHAEL] Try 80.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
[MICHAEL] Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
[MICHAEL] I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great  Just a little something to remember the trip by. A little to your left
[MICHAEL] What's going on? Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?
[MICHAEL] Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?
[MICHAEL] Excellent! Way to go! Nice!
[MICHAEL] I... Okay, okay, okay,  alright, thank you.
[MICHAEL] Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
[MICHAEL] I cannot wait to contact your clients.
[MICHAEL] Haha, we struck the mother load!
[MICHAEL] Wallace is going to freak.
[MICHAEL] He's going to absolutely freak.
[MICHAEL] Oh shoot.
[MICHAEL] Oh God, what was that?
[MICHAEL] Aw, it's alright.
[MICHAEL] Aw, my car.
[MICHAEL] No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
[MICHAEL] Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...
[MICHAEL] No, no, really not necessary.
[MICHAEL] You know let me give you some money for this.
[MICHAEL] Oh coffee, that's too much.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
[MICHAEL] Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine.
[MICHAEL] Why don't we just, live and let live?
[MICHAEL] Live and let live.
[MICHAEL] It's from James Bond.
[MICHAEL] I'm not going to make this call.
[MICHAEL] My heart says...
[MICHAEL] That is true.
[MICHAEL] That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
[MICHAEL] Jan... Ryan.
[MICHAEL] You're right.
[MICHAEL] You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
[MICHAEL] Just something I have to do first.
[MICHAEL] Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone
[MICHAEL] Oh shoot!
[MICHAEL] Those people will be ruined.
[MICHAEL] Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people.
[MICHAEL] Im not a shark.
[MICHAEL] Mpfh.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Okay, bye bye.
[MICHAEL] I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
[MICHAEL] Oh, she is hot.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God! Okay, it happening. Everybody stay calm.
[MICHAEL] Stay  calm!
[MICHAEL] Everyone, now  calm down!
[MICHAEL] What does warm mean?
[MICHAEL] Don't run.
[MICHAEL] Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
[MICHAEL] Okay, we're trapped. Everyone for himself.
[MICHAEL] Help!! Help!!
[MICHAEL] No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president! You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
[MICHAEL] He's going to swallow is tongue.
[MICHAEL] Open your mouth. Come on. Don't swallow it.
[MICHAEL] Leave me al--
[MICHAEL] Saving him!
[MICHAEL] Electricity.
[MICHAEL] Hed. Hedded
[MICHAEL] Take hedded of.
[MICHAEL] Heed. Heed.
[MICHAEL] Take heed of.
[MICHAEL] Take heed of.
[MICHAEL] Okay.  This city. Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed.
[MICHAEL] Yes. We are. We are livid. But we are going to let this one slide.
[MICHAEL] I am not a mind reader, David.
[MICHAEL] And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice. Something that Dwight doesn't like.
[MICHAEL] Do you?
[MICHAEL] You talking to me?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] No, Dwight. I am worried. A man's life is in my hands.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] That's not gonna happen. I'm taking over as safety man.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] I'm a smart guy. I'll figure it out.
[MICHAEL] No, I will.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. No debate. You are going to sit in that wheelchair until you are back on your feet.
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what? That could be a little confusing, because in sales A-B-C means "always be closing."
[MICHAEL] Shut it. Shut it.
[MICHAEL] You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
[MICHAEL] Come on.
[MICHAEL] No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working. What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
[MICHAEL] And you're okay with that?
[MICHAEL] Uh-uh. No, no, no. Come on. Get up. Let's do this.
[MICHAEL] This is you we're talking about.
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. I'll show them. Here we go.  Stanley. All right.
[MICHAEL] No, Rose. They are not breathing. And they have no arms or legs.
[MICHAEL] Where are they? You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
[MICHAEL] How about no arms? No arms or legs is basically how you exist right now, Kevin. You don't do anything.
[MICHAEL] okay, that's uh, hard to keep track. How many is that per hour?
[MICHAEL] I will divide and then count to it.
[MICHAEL] Yes, yes I do. I love that song.  First I was afraid, I was petrified.
[MICHAEL] Okay, I got it.
[MICHAEL] Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive  Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
[MICHAEL] He is an organ donor.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Stanley.
[MICHAEL] Are you okay?
[MICHAEL] Five thousand three hundred dollars for a dummy?
[MICHAEL] Okay, look. David, this is why we have training. We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
[MICHAEL] Let's hear it.
[MICHAEL] And you walk up toward the castle, and inside the castle are 4 men, and each of them, none of them have shoes, and they give you a funny cigarette, and you feel even more relaxed, and then you want ice cream. You want a big bowl of ice cream. What kind do you want? Shout it out.
[MICHAEL] Too expensive.
[MICHAEL] Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?  What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
[MICHAEL] Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
[MICHAEL] You have stress?
[MICHAEL] During our relaxation exercise?
[MICHAEL] No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Let me getcha.
[MICHAEL] Ok, alright.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay?  Let's give this a shot.
[MICHAEL] Oh...
[MICHAEL] Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
[MICHAEL] What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other...
[MICHAEL] Si senor.
[MICHAEL] It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
[MICHAEL] Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.  So, we all know how these work, needs to get crazy, take your best shot. I am going to sit right here on my chair and... ah... whoever wants to come up and roast me, you may.  Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
[MICHAEL] Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
[MICHAEL] You're so lucky! Good one...
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Pow pow pow...
[MICHAEL] I know where this is goin'.
[MICHAEL] No...
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Spite her - ok
[MICHAEL] Oh, stop it Dwight.
[MICHAEL] No no no no no no!
[MICHAEL] Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
[MICHAEL] That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
[MICHAEL] Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
[MICHAEL] Idiot.
[MICHAEL] Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
[MICHAEL] Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
[MICHAEL] We are, we are a family.
[MICHAEL] Oh very funny.
[MICHAEL] Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
[MICHAEL] I don't believe I have had the pleasure.
[MICHAEL] Jefferson.
[MICHAEL] Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there.  Dozens of online IQ test might prove you wrong, but, and my thing isn't tiny, its average, so... get your facts straight.  So when I heard that there was going to be a roast in my honor, I thought  sorry.  I think I have a frog in my throat. Um...  I decided to jot down some quick thoughts about you people, um, first up Phyllis and Kevin. Uh um...
[MICHAEL] I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
[MICHAEL] Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela?  Whoa there you are, I didn't see you there behind that grain of rice. Boom. Roasted. Stanley, you crush your wife during s*x and your heart sucks. Boom. Roasted. Oscar, you are...  Oscar, you're gay.
[MICHAEL] Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted.  Alright. Alright everybody, you know I kid, you know I kid. You guys are the reason I went into the paper business, so, uh, goodnight, God bless, God bless America, and get home safe.
[MICHAEL] This is your captain speaking, the office will be flying at an altitude of two stories. Look out your left hand window and you will see Vance Refrigeration.  I am the ghost of salesman past, do not come near me.  Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
[MICHAEL] Toby Flenderson to the principal's office. Your mother called, and it appears that you wet the bed again. So you have to get home to wash your sheets  because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] You find it?
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
[MICHAEL] You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.
[MICHAEL] No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go!  Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
[MICHAEL] Well that goes without saying.
[MICHAEL] Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant? That's...
[MICHAEL] ...kind of  Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
[MICHAEL] No. Oh, all right.
[MICHAEL] No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
[MICHAEL] Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
[MICHAEL] Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
[MICHAEL] You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
[MICHAEL] Is that why your wearing makeup today?
[MICHAEL] Rolando,  I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
[MICHAEL] Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.
[MICHAEL] That's what I do, steal my trick.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God. Is that Jim's?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had s*x, and...
[MICHAEL] Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
[MICHAEL] I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
[MICHAEL] Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?
[MICHAEL] Got it. It works.
[MICHAEL] But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
[MICHAEL] Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
[MICHAEL] Oh, I still have more.
[MICHAEL] She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, let's go.
[MICHAEL] No, don't worry, the chain is off.
[MICHAEL] Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.
[MICHAEL] It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
[MICHAEL] Oh, great.
[MICHAEL] No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.
[MICHAEL] Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
[MICHAEL] Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] No. I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
[MICHAEL] Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
[MICHAEL] She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
[MICHAEL] I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. ... Um... is, uh, Holly Flax anywhere here?
[MICHAEL] Oh- She's not here?
[MICHAEL] A.J.
[MICHAEL] How could she do this to me, Pam?
[MICHAEL] I can't do the presentation, I can't-  ... just... oh... thinking about seeing him... and... thinking about... him getting to hold her and getting to kiss her, it just- oh, God!
[MICHAEL] I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay?
[MICHAEL] And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
[MICHAEL] I can do this.
[MICHAEL] A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?
[MICHAEL] Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?
[MICHAEL] Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?
[MICHAEL] Huh-  Does she ever talk about me?
[MICHAEL] It's all connected. Shut up.  Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'
[MICHAEL] Does it feel good?
[MICHAEL] Your life.  Oh, wow. Whew. Ahh, legs are sorta giving out. Long drive in the car, so let's just- We'll just continue.  Oh, wow.  Ooh, okay.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards.
[MICHAEL] No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right.  Okay... okay.
[MICHAEL] I went through Holly's things.
[MICHAEL] I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
[MICHAEL] I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael."
[MICHAEL] I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
[MICHAEL] No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] How?
[MICHAEL] I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
[MICHAEL] No, that wouldn't-
[MICHAEL] No, you don't have to do that.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Well?
[MICHAEL] She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
[MICHAEL] You're sure?
[MICHAEL] Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
[MICHAEL] Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
[MICHAEL] Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
[MICHAEL] Hello, may I help you?
[MICHAEL] ...Jim.
[MICHAEL] Ayyyy!
[MICHAEL] Ayyyy!
[MICHAEL] What was that?
[MICHAEL] That was funny. Let's go do it to somebody else. Ayyyy!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I hear ya. It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy. So if you think you're hurting...
[MICHAEL] Can I have a word with you, Jim?
[MICHAEL] Yes, um, Jim. Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
[MICHAEL] --that none of us can be a part of--
[MICHAEL] --then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.
[MICHAEL] So suck it. Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
[MICHAEL] So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Hello.
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, me too.
[MICHAEL] Oh, well, that's fine.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, can I point something out to you?
[MICHAEL] You're actually talking a lot.
[MICHAEL] Okay, here we go.
[MICHAEL] Oh, God.
[MICHAEL] Yup, I'm good, whew. Wow, I feel like a human juicebox.  Hawaiian blood punch.
[MICHAEL] Type O-Ocean Spray.
[MICHAEL] I looked at the bag.
[MICHAEL] I looked straight at the bag.
[MICHAEL] Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?
[MICHAEL] That was mean.
[MICHAEL] A hat.
[MICHAEL] That is full of soup.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oh, already.
[MICHAEL] Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days.
[MICHAEL] Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?
[MICHAEL] OK. Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers. This is hers, she left her glove. I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random s*x.  Okay, sorry, let's, who else? Oscar.
[MICHAEL] Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.
[MICHAEL] If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure? I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault. OK well, who else?
[MICHAEL] Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
[MICHAEL] Really sad.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God.
[MICHAEL] Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
[MICHAEL] Alright who's next? Where's Andy?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too. We just need to find them. There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park. There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
[MICHAEL] No. Not a giant net.
[MICHAEL] I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
[MICHAEL] Old fashioned meet market --
[MICHAEL] -- I don't think it is.
[MICHAEL] Ah, still early.
[MICHAEL] So how you holding up?
[MICHAEL] No. No, I meant about being single today.
[MICHAEL] Meh, exactly. Eh.
[MICHAEL] Oh, here we go.
[MICHAEL] Hello.
[MICHAEL] Babe alert!  Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
[MICHAEL] Lynn, follow me, come on in. For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone. Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
[MICHAEL] So run with the ball! Run with it, Kev.  Where you from?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, OK. Well, he only gets better.
[MICHAEL] Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair. Alright, I'll let you guys talk.
[MICHAEL] No reason.
[MICHAEL] Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
[MICHAEL] It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
[MICHAEL] Believe me its nothing. I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
[MICHAEL] Nah.
[MICHAEL] Hey, you don't deserve her.
[MICHAEL] Really?  Oh, thanks.
[MICHAEL] You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
[MICHAEL] OK.
[MICHAEL] Pam?
[MICHAEL] Pam? Knock, knock.
[MICHAEL] I know you are. Knock, knock.
[MICHAEL] 4-9-1-7-4-5-1
[MICHAEL] They would never know it was me doing it. Here we go, Knock, knock.
[MICHAEL] Buddha.
[MICHAEL] Buddha this bread for me, won't you?
[MICHAEL] I, I need something to wipe my hand.
[MICHAEL] That was helping. It was classic.
[MICHAEL] No... God.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Who's there?
[MICHAEL] KGB -
[MICHAEL] What the hell was that?
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] You, you like that?
[MICHAEL] Mine was retribution. What are you doing? No more knock-knock jokes. That's it.
[MICHAEL] Who's there?
[MICHAEL] Dwight, get the door.
[MICHAEL] Answer the door.
[MICHAEL] I'm not gonna answer it
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa.
[MICHAEL] Why thank you very much.  Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
[MICHAEL] Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
[MICHAEL] No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon.
[MICHAEL] No, you don't. No, it -  What will be the state of this company if I am the only one coming up with the great ideas? Right?
[MICHAEL] Woo hoo.
[MICHAEL] Tell me
[MICHAEL] ...or an odd little boy with a cowboy obsession?
[MICHAEL] Invite them on the tour.
[MICHAEL] Really? That's kind of a big client.  Hey, Oscar. Woo hoo hoo. Um, how much of a hit is ten percent of our Blue Cross account?
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I thought I did. So...
[MICHAEL] Well no harm no foul.
[MICHAEL] You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
[MICHAEL] Sir. I placed a bunch of golden tickets into five separate boxes and some how they all ended up with Blue Cross. How does this happen?
[MICHAEL] Irrelevant.
[MICHAEL] OK, I'm going to ask you something and I want you to be honest. What is a pallet?
[MICHAEL] No, they can't.
[MICHAEL] Oscar, you don't know what the hell you are talking about.
[MICHAEL] Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so -
[MICHAEL] Thank you, Jim is with me.
[MICHAEL] Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
[MICHAEL] OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.  Yes.
[MICHAEL] OK, don't get that. Please?
[MICHAEL] That is not constructive.
[MICHAEL] How are you doing?
[MICHAEL] My colonoscopy was an examination of my large colon and the distal part of my small bowel with a camera.
[MICHAEL] Well, there is an explanation that involves me not letting it happen and I just don't... I don't know.
[MICHAEL] I think we might have hired an outside marketing consultant.
[MICHAEL] You're breaking up.
[MICHAEL] OK, I think, it might have been an inside consultant.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Woah, wow, who told you that?
[MICHAEL] No, I don't think I ever did. That was your idea Dwight.
[MICHAEL] I'm not taking... I'm not taking...
[MICHAEL] Wait a second, wait a second, I wrote it down in my diary.
[MICHAEL] Yes I do. You've just never seen it.  March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets.
[MICHAEL] Why do you have a diary?
[MICHAEL] OK, you know what? You came up with this idea. I remember you told me that you loved the Willy Wonka movie when you were growing up.
[MICHAEL] Yes, you did.
[MICHAEL] What are you writing?
[MICHAEL] Would you like to go to lunch with me? Just the two of us?
[MICHAEL] Umm, nacho chips.
[MICHAEL] Oh, OK. Let me just cut to the chase, Dwight. I want you to fall on your sword for me.
[MICHAEL] It's not ready yet.
[MICHAEL] Yes they are, you just don't care about the information.
[MICHAEL] He doesn't love it that much. Wouldn't be such a bad thing for him to be fired.
[MICHAEL] I mean, like we were talking about that is why he has come to the conclusion...
[MICHAEL] Right.
[MICHAEL] That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom.
[MICHAEL] That's why you made the decision. That's why you made...
[MICHAEL] You kind of have.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes it is, but it had to be done, didn't it?
[MICHAEL] Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea?
[MICHAEL] Really? How did-- how are you inspired? How did it pop into your head Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Give me the details of how that happened.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] David? David?
[MICHAEL] David?
[MICHAEL] Could I be a part of the meeting also?
[MICHAEL] There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
[MICHAEL] I can't... vouch for that. But I do know this. He is a liar. He has taken my idea.
[MICHAEL] OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that?
[MICHAEL] Oh how dare you.
[MICHAEL] You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard?
[MICHAEL] Oh please.
[MICHAEL] Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
[MICHAEL] ...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas.
[MICHAEL] They're not easy. Everybody has to go to the bathroom.
[MICHAEL] Thank You!
[MICHAEL] Well David, I will be honest with you. I do want the credit without any of the blame.
[MICHAEL] I want to see it.
[MICHAEL] I want to see it.
[MICHAEL] Give me... Give me the diary.
[MICHAEL] I like it.
[MICHAEL] I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
[MICHAEL] And classy, yeah.
[MICHAEL] You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] He is.
[MICHAEL] That's what makes him classy.
[MICHAEL] Strawberries?
[MICHAEL] Not classy at all.
[MICHAEL] French. Classy.
[MICHAEL] Yes?
[MICHAEL] Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
[MICHAEL] Uh-huh.  Well, well, well, who have we here? Ah, it is Prince Charles Miner.  At your service. Everybody, this is Sir Charles Miner and he is the new VP for the Northeast region. So, just give it up for this big guy, right? Give it up.  Here he is.
[MICHAEL] Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us .  Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
[MICHAEL] You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
[MICHAEL] Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go!  Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
[MICHAEL] Took me all night.
[MICHAEL] Oh, nerd alert!
[MICHAEL] This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that.
[MICHAEL] This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange
[MICHAEL] There you go! Where's the other?
[MICHAEL] Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history.
[MICHAEL] Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner.
[MICHAEL] Oh! Well...
[MICHAEL] Above and beyond.
[MICHAEL] That's true.
[MICHAEL] No. Absolutely not.
[MICHAEL] Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
[MICHAEL] Well, why don't-
[MICHAEL] Charles is going to tell you.
[MICHAEL] Well, it's not official.
[MICHAEL] Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
[MICHAEL] Well-
[MICHAEL] Ok, ok, you know what? I think this has been great. I think this gives us a lot to think about, doesn't it? Charles Miner, ladies and gentlemen.  He has a long trip home. Thank you for coming in. We have to get back to work.
[MICHAEL] Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet.
[MICHAEL] It was my understanding.
[MICHAEL] Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability.
[MICHAEL] But the branch is still mine?
[MICHAEL] Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party?
[MICHAEL] Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff?
[MICHAEL] Come on. What's your wife's name? Where did you work before you came here?
[MICHAEL] Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names.
[MICHAEL] You're not from paper?
[MICHAEL] Does David know this?
[MICHAEL] Well that, actually, is an excellent segue into really what is my only point-
[MICHAEL] And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
[MICHAEL] Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
[MICHAEL] Whatever David wants.
[MICHAEL] No! You idiot!  Idiot, idiot, idiot! What are you doing? God! Oh my god.
[MICHAEL] Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine.
[MICHAEL] And I really really need to talk to David.
[MICHAEL] I was never given a name.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
[MICHAEL] I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
[MICHAEL] Nobody thanked me.
[MICHAEL] For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
[MICHAEL] Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
[MICHAEL] Yes it is!
[MICHAEL] No, it is not.
[MICHAEL] Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
[MICHAEL] Ok, Michael, what are you doing?
[MICHAEL] No, seriously.
[MICHAEL] How old are you?
[MICHAEL] Five years old?
[MICHAEL] I'm gonna walk away.
[MICHAEL] I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
[MICHAEL] What is that smaller stripper holding?
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
[MICHAEL] Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
[MICHAEL] It's a great idea. And we have a cake in the shape of a bale of hay.
[MICHAEL] But it's cool, and it's-
[MICHAEL] Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
[MICHAEL] Yeah, why don't you do that?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, here we go. Ok.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Newsflash: I've been here for fifteen years. Headline: You have been here one day. End of story. You have no right to cancel my fifteenth anniversary party. End of story. End of story. End of story!
[MICHAEL] Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace.  I'm going to tell him everything. And I'm sorry to say, you're screwed. And, you know what? You are gonna be through. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry to do that to you. Do you even know how paper is made? It's not like steel. You don't put it into a furnace. If you put paper into a furnace, you know what would happen? You'd ruin it.
[MICHAEL] So is this the meeting you've been in all day?
[MICHAEL] I drove.
[MICHAEL] Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
[MICHAEL] Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
[MICHAEL] Clearly that's what you wanted.
[MICHAEL] Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot.
[MICHAEL] I've put having a family on hold.
[MICHAEL] And I've never gone hang-gliding. And I've never driven my car to the top of Mount Washington.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] I quit.
[MICHAEL] You have no idea how high I can fly.
[MICHAEL] Okay, so. I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken! So I have to take the normal door.
[MICHAEL] No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
[MICHAEL] I looked at Wallace and I said "I quit!" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said "You have no idea how high I can fly."
[MICHAEL] Why would I do that?
[MICHAEL] You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
[MICHAEL] Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.  Clinky, clinky-clink. Come-on... come on, come on.
[MICHAEL] I have a job.
[MICHAEL] Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job. You are head-hunted.
[MICHAEL] Any good headhunter knows I am available.
[MICHAEL] You're 'I need you to' is my command.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world.  Oh God! Blech! Phyllis!
[MICHAEL] Oh! Hey. What is this about?
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Me too, me too. Is this wine?
[MICHAEL] I already have wine.
[MICHAEL] Hmm?
[MICHAEL] For?
[MICHAEL] Yes I am.
[MICHAEL] That's a drive!
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] What am I gong to do? Uh... .
[MICHAEL] Just close your eyes. I'm going to start my own paper company.
[MICHAEL] yeah!
[MICHAEL] Can you believe... cause I know paper. I know everything there is to know about paper.
[MICHAEL] Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
[MICHAEL] Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.
[MICHAEL] Close them.
[MICHAEL] Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this?
[MICHAEL] Obviously.
[MICHAEL] Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
[MICHAEL] Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
[MICHAEL] No I'm staying.
[MICHAEL] You... oh. Somebody has been talking in bed. Pillow talk.
[MICHAEL] This is a dream that I have had since lunch, and I am not giving up on it now.
[MICHAEL] Before you got here, I'm the one who landed all these clients. Half of them, at least. I can do it again. I know the market, I know the price points. I'm on it, don't worry. So, how do I do that?
[MICHAEL] Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
[MICHAEL] Thank you very much.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. In all climates. It's going to be worldwide. And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me. That's where you come in.
[MICHAEL] Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now so
[MICHAEL] Potential, lots of potential. yes.
[MICHAEL] It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
[MICHAEL] That's what I was thinking, with the farm, so... You getting to wherever I'm gonna put my thing.
[MICHAEL] So think about it. Lets put a pin in it for now.
[MICHAEL] I made it sterile.
[MICHAEL] I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.
[MICHAEL] No, no no.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay, hey, you already have the job. You don't have to convince me.
[MICHAEL] Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.
[MICHAEL] Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
[MICHAEL] Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
[MICHAEL] Hmm?
[MICHAEL] Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks...
[MICHAEL] Hank? You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you? Hank, please escort Charles from the building.
[MICHAEL] ... and I feel free!
[MICHAEL] Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
[MICHAEL] Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
[MICHAEL] I was going to, I wanted to. But I had to start somewhere.
[MICHAEL] No, of course not. But now I want everybody. Jim! Jim? Buddy, Hey! Buddy, Jimbo? Did you have time to think about my offer?
[MICHAEL] So which way are you leaning?
[MICHAEL] Thanks Jim.
[MICHAEL] Okay, Okay, we don't have much time. Just act normal. Don't look at me people. Stop. Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me. Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height. Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future. Hello, I am your future. You're older, and you are very happy now. Because you went with Michael Scott. Right. So everybody come on down. Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright? Come on! Are you, are you doing your best here? Are you being the best that you can be?  Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot. Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me. Come on Phyllis.

[MICHAEL] Oh God... okay alright. It's time to go it's time to go. Jim, let's go. Come on!

[MICHAEL] Yes I was. Yes I was.
[MICHAEL] That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
[MICHAEL] What shape?
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] After breakfast.
[MICHAEL] So how you feeling about the new company?
[MICHAEL] You excited? About the new company?
[MICHAEL] After breakfast.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm whipping them.
[MICHAEL] Just let go.
[MICHAEL] Let go, please. Just gimmee -
[MICHAEL] I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
[MICHAEL] I'm not overwhelmed, Pam.
[MICHAEL] Don't patronize me, Pam.
[MICHAEL] I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
[MICHAEL] It's totally impossible!
[MICHAEL] Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
[MICHAEL] Okay, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
[MICHAEL] Umm... Oh! Vikram! Best salesman I've ever met.
[MICHAEL] He worked at that telemarketing place.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Oh also, we have a meeting this afternoon with a potential investor.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'.  Umm...
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Wow. "Michael Scott Paper Company." Okay. Very official. "Dear Mr. Scott. Please be advised that it is in violation of your condominium agreement to conduct a business headquartered in your residence. The penalty, a forfeiture of residence."
[MICHAEL] How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart."
[MICHAEL] No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs.
[MICHAEL] We can do this.
[MICHAEL] Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
[MICHAEL] I'm...
[MICHAEL] Excuse me. Yes?
[MICHAEL] Yes, it is.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] It is.
[MICHAEL] Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
[MICHAEL] Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
[MICHAEL] Uh, nine.
[MICHAEL] Look what he's doing.
[MICHAEL] He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
[MICHAEL] He's already paying for himself.
[MICHAEL] Right here.
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah.
[MICHAEL] Sounds awesome.
[MICHAEL] Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
[MICHAEL] By wanting it more. By working hard-
[MICHAEL] Mmmm-My mission is stated as follows: I will not be beat. I will never give up. I am on a mission. That is the Michael Scott guarantee.
[MICHAEL] Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
[MICHAEL] Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
[MICHAEL] Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that.
[MICHAEL] What's that?
[MICHAEL] Blech.
[MICHAEL] Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
[MICHAEL] Well we should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay...
[MICHAEL] I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
[MICHAEL] So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?
[MICHAEL] It's right in the middle of the paper belt.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I'm good. You good?
[MICHAEL] Yes, I am, Charles.
[MICHAEL] Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
[MICHAEL] Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride!
[MICHAEL] We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
[MICHAEL] Hey you said you were gonna be out of town this weekend.
[MICHAEL] Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
[MICHAEL] Stop it stop it! Bickering! Stop it!
[MICHAEL] Would someone just make the copy?
[MICHAEL] Just make that copy okay?
[MICHAEL] They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
[MICHAEL] I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
[MICHAEL] Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
[MICHAEL] Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right? 1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
[MICHAEL] No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house."
[MICHAEL] No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
[MICHAEL] Pam, I don't make the rules.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.
[MICHAEL] What for?
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
[MICHAEL] You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
[MICHAEL] These are shaped like paper.
[MICHAEL] Don't tell them we have free delivery!
[MICHAEL] They don't know that!
[MICHAEL] Give him a guarantee.
[MICHAEL] Just say the word.
[MICHAEL] Yes!
[MICHAEL] You did!
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah!
[MICHAEL] She did it!
[MICHAEL] Hup!
[MICHAEL] Is this good?
[MICHAEL] Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
[MICHAEL] I really appreciate it.
[MICHAEL] It's for your trouble.
[MICHAEL] No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I do.
[MICHAEL] That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
[MICHAEL] That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
[MICHAEL] Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
[MICHAEL] Bring it in. Morning cheer.
[MICHAEL] Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
[MICHAEL] I'm not following you.
[MICHAEL] Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift.
[MICHAEL] Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing?
[MICHAEL] Can I use it?
[MICHAEL] Dwight, are you talking about us?
[MICHAEL] Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
[MICHAEL] So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
[MICHAEL] Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
[MICHAEL] Dwight?
[MICHAEL] Is the cool new guy Charles?
[MICHAEL] Is it Stanley?
[MICHAEL] Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup!
[MICHAEL] Dwight, run!
[MICHAEL] You be cool.
[MICHAEL] Just-what's going on?
[MICHAEL] Mm-do... Dwight would not-
[MICHAEL] I. Understand. Nothing.
[MICHAEL] It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
[MICHAEL] It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon.
[MICHAEL] I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
[MICHAEL] Hello, traitor.
[MICHAEL] I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
[MICHAEL] I'm just getting hardcore with him.
[MICHAEL] Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby.
[MICHAEL] Wow. High score?
[MICHAEL] So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
[MICHAEL] No. No. You think I am going to fall for that? There's no-
[MICHAEL] Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
[MICHAEL] Toward the sun.
[MICHAEL] Noon.
[MICHAEL] You have two seconds.
[MICHAEL] Dwight.
[MICHAEL] I hope you're not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
[MICHAEL] So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
[MICHAEL] If you want a truce, I will give you a truce.
[MICHAEL] I do too.
[MICHAEL] Cooper's.
[MICHAEL] Damn it.
[MICHAEL] Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, sure.
[MICHAEL] Okay, see you in a bit. Dwight hit a bear. He'll be here in a sec.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
[MICHAEL] No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic.  You?
[MICHAEL] What about our truce?
[MICHAEL] On purpose?
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
[MICHAEL] Oh.  b*st*rd!
[MICHAEL] Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
[MICHAEL] If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed.
[MICHAEL] Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
[MICHAEL] Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
[MICHAEL] You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
[MICHAEL] Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
[MICHAEL] Walking in the door...
[MICHAEL] Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door.
[MICHAEL] Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
[MICHAEL] That's very rude.
[MICHAEL] I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
[MICHAEL] Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
[MICHAEL] That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.
[MICHAEL] Good, good, good. I will see you.
[MICHAEL] Milk and sugar.
[MICHAEL] That's what I said.
[MICHAEL] Every morning.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
[MICHAEL] Like in a dorm room. You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top. You can sleep up top.
[MICHAEL] Most do in the magazines.
[MICHAEL] We should look into that. Or we just go for the loft.
[MICHAEL] They are correct, sir.
[MICHAEL] Okay. A lame attempt at humor. Swing and a miss.
[MICHAEL] Lowest in town.
[MICHAEL] Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
[MICHAEL] Explain that.
[MICHAEL] Well, we don't--
[MICHAEL] Whatever, yeah.
[MICHAEL] Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
[MICHAEL] Just crunch 'em. Just crunch 'em please.
[MICHAEL] I know. But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life. I was wrong. It's this.
[MICHAEL] I would love that.
[MICHAEL] Was it nice?
[MICHAEL] I love Pad Thai.
[MICHAEL] No. There's a lot I haven't done.
[MICHAEL] We're not hiring, Jim.
[MICHAEL] Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.
[MICHAEL] Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl--
[MICHAEL] No-- We don't have--
[MICHAEL] Uh... Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
[MICHAEL] That's a pun.
[MICHAEL] Yep. Oh... wow.
[MICHAEL] Of course not.
[MICHAEL] Nope, nope, nope.
[MICHAEL] Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
[MICHAEL] Ah...
[MICHAEL] I'm good, I'm good.
[MICHAEL] It is. I'm good.
[MICHAEL] Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace. I believe we're expected.  Well, well, well. How the turntables...
[MICHAEL] And we are prepared to reject that offer.
[MICHAEL] Never accept their first offer. What is your second offer?
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me? That is insultingly low. I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
[MICHAEL] I'll see your situation and I'll raise you a situation. Your company is losing clients left and right. You have a stockholder meeting coming up and you're going to have to explain to them why your most profitable branch is bleeding. So they may be looking for a little change in the CFO. So I don't think I need to wait out Dunder Mifflin. I think I just have to wait out you.
[MICHAEL] We'll have to talk--
[MICHAEL] Just amongst ourselves.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[MICHAEL] We are so rich.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] It's a lot of money, okay. But we need money coming in every week. We need jobs. Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?
[MICHAEL] Agreed?
[MICHAEL] Shut up, shut up. Hello?
[MICHAEL] And I want Charles gone.
[MICHAEL] I need him gone.
[MICHAEL] Okay, then I want Pam back.
[MICHAEL] Sales.
[MICHAEL] Yes, she is. At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.
[MICHAEL] And Ryan.
[MICHAEL] You know, David. I don't care if Ryan murdered his entire family he is like a son to me.
[MICHAEL] And dental this time.
[MICHAEL] These are our demands.
[MICHAEL] Our company is worth nothing. That's the difference between you and I. Business isn't about money to me, David. If tomorrow my company goes under, I will just start another paper company. And then another and another and another. I have no shortage of company names.
[MICHAEL] That's one of 'em! Yes. These are our demands. This is what we want. Our balls are in your court.
[MICHAEL] Can we have the room please?
[MICHAEL] Yes! Can you believe it? That's what I'm talking about!
[MICHAEL] No, no. You're done.
[MICHAEL] It's Michael Scott.  Hold it up. Conference room, five minutes.
[MICHAEL] If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Take it up with Toby. What I want you to do, is I want you to look inward. And I want you to reflect. And I want you to say something different.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Not important.  Okay, alright. Yes. Yes, you have a job. Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.
[MICHAEL] It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
[MICHAEL] No, you lost those clients.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay, Dwight. Let me explain something to you. I set the rules and you follow them. Blindly. Okay? And if you have a problem with that then you can talk to our complaint department. It's a trash can.
[MICHAEL] Pamela.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] I do? Well--Where is that bowl?
[MICHAEL] Michael Scott Paper Company only.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well---
[MICHAEL] I will--no, no. I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.
[MICHAEL] Against who?
[MICHAEL] That was us, right there.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, the Commish.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
[MICHAEL] Where'd you eat?
[MICHAEL] What'd you have, Stanley?
[MICHAEL] So since you guys already ate, you won't be eating the stuff you brought with you for lunch, will you?  Oh, wow, Stanley. Is that egg salad? Andy brought some salmon.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, is that a meat sandwich? You guys hungry?
[MICHAEL] I'm going to o have some of this meat sandwich.
[MICHAEL] Mom. What kind of sauce is on your salmon?
[MICHAEL] Mmm. Thanks for going out, guys.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey guys. You know what I want you to do? Shake hands, get over it. That was not a shake, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Who quits?
[MICHAEL] You guys gotta be kidding.
[MICHAEL] I love it. I love this idea, and I fully support you. As a matter of fact, I'm going to give you some seed money.  There you go. There's some seed money for you. And you can take it, no hard feelings. But if you stay, I want an apology, and I want a big one.
[MICHAEL] Yes I do.
[MICHAEL] It's frontward's.
[MICHAEL] Whatever you guys did earlier.
[MICHAEL] Just do it, okay?
[MICHAEL] Get 'em there. Get 'em there.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me?
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay, okay.
[MICHAEL] If we could just focus and go down the line, and everyone would say, "apology accepted", I think we would all feel better. And then we can break out my gift to you--complimentary white chocolate bark.
[MICHAEL] They wouldn't make it unless people liked it.
[MICHAEL] Okay. If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
[MICHAEL] Fine, have your clients. I can see that's what you wanted all along.  However, I rescind my apology.
[MICHAEL] You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.
[MICHAEL] Jim. Can I talk to you for a minute?
[MICHAEL] And Bingo was his name. Let's go.
[MICHAEL] You're close with Pam too.
[MICHAEL] Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.
[MICHAEL] I like his hair.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] That sounds pretty biased.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Pam, pros.
[MICHAEL] I like her. I think that she is a fast learner. Cons, she doesn't always follow through. Sh--New York and the whole art school thing. And Roy. She has a weird voice.
[MICHAEL] I don't need to tell you that.
[MICHAEL] I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
[MICHAEL] Okay. So be it, then you've lost credibility. And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow! Whoa!
[MICHAEL] Ho-ho, man! Wow.  Honey! I want you to bring the garbage out. 'Cause I'm not going to have s*x with you unless you bring out the garba--
[MICHAEL] I gave Ryan the sales job. There just weren't enough clients for the two of you. So I had to--
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry, sorry.
[MICHAEL] Yes, you did.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] No, you--no.
[MICHAEL] No, you're the best person for the job. You're going to be great.
[MICHAEL] Oh, oh!
[MICHAEL] You should have seen your face. Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
[MICHAEL] Oh, really?
[MICHAEL] Oh, man. That was really good. That was really good.
[MICHAEL] I don't know, I offered him his temp job back. We'll see. He was not happy at all when I offered him this job and then I told him he didn't get the job, so--
[MICHAEL] I don't appreciate you telling me what to do. So clean out your desk, you are through here.
[MICHAEL] Oh! What's our receptionists name?
[MICHAEL] Could you send her in?
[MICHAEL] Hello.
[MICHAEL] Have a seat.
[MICHAEL] He will be ushering you out.
[MICHAEL] Oh, your face! Oh!
[MICHAEL] No, I'm kidding. No, you're not--you're not fired. Yet.
[MICHAEL] Oh...
[MICHAEL] I don't know, actually.
[MICHAEL] Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
[MICHAEL] Oh, really? Ok.
[MICHAEL] What about the rest of you?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
[MICHAEL] I... was just learning... to... love.
[MICHAEL] No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
[MICHAEL] That's good.
[MICHAEL] If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so...
[MICHAEL] Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Now you got it.
[MICHAEL] Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
[MICHAEL] You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
[MICHAEL] Ok. I love it. I love it.
[MICHAEL] I love it.
[MICHAEL] I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
[MICHAEL] Andy's afwaid?
[MICHAEL] Are you all afwaid?
[MICHAEL] Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
[MICHAEL] Funk is the problem and the solution.
[MICHAEL] I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
[MICHAEL] Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
[MICHAEL] No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
[MICHAEL] ... with coffee but without the haunted.
[MICHAEL] It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
[MICHAEL] Exactly.
[MICHAEL] Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
[MICHAEL] Holdin' down the fort.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
[MICHAEL] Kevin, stay.
[MICHAEL] Kevin, stay.
[MICHAEL] Stay, stay.
[MICHAEL] Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
[MICHAEL] Mmm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] Come on.
[MICHAEL] Hey!
[MICHAEL] Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
[MICHAEL] Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow! What did you do?
[MICHAEL] Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
[MICHAEL] No. No. No.
[MICHAEL] It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
[MICHAEL] We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
[MICHAEL] I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
[MICHAEL] It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
[MICHAEL] You having fun?
[MICHAEL] What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
[MICHAEL] Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you know. Nohting. She's - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So...
[MICHAEL] Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything.
[MICHAEL] You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
[MICHAEL] I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
[MICHAEL] I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
[MICHAEL] Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
[MICHAEL] Oh. Alright. There you go.
[MICHAEL] No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
[MICHAEL] I know. I know, Angela. A lot of people doubted Cafe Disco at first but it is a magical place. You have to give it a chance. If these walls could tale they would say, " This is a magical place! You are safe here. We have talking walls. We're not going to eat you."  No.
[MICHAEL] Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
[MICHAEL] No... cleaning... up.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!  Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to "Y".
[MICHAEL] Uh oh. What's so funny?
[MICHAEL] Oh yay! Geography joke.  Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
[MICHAEL] We're just friends.  Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
[MICHAEL] All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.
[MICHAEL] A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
[MICHAEL] Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] You can go to hell.  I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
[MICHAEL] Cool. For who?
[MICHAEL] Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
[MICHAEL] All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
[MICHAEL] You bet your fat ass we are.
[MICHAEL] That's right.
[MICHAEL] Newspapers for sale!
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
[MICHAEL] Oh!
[MICHAEL] Could we get a Delorean?
[MICHAEL] Oh!  Dun-der. Dun-der...
[MICHAEL] Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!!
[MICHAEL] No. No.
[MICHAEL] We're circling it.
[MICHAEL] Uh, it's a sketch now.
[MICHAEL] And now, presenting...
[MICHAEL] Yes, I am.
[MICHAEL] Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
[MICHAEL] Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
[MICHAEL] I'm Robert Mifflin.  Ah, okay.
[MICHAEL] Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
[MICHAEL] Yes!
[MICHAEL] I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
[MICHAEL] David Wallace told me!!
[MICHAEL] I guess not.
[MICHAEL] Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
[MICHAEL] Should've had hindsight.
[MICHAEL] I think it went well. I think it was good.
[MICHAEL] No, it was a tough audience.
[MICHAEL] Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
[MICHAEL] Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
[MICHAEL] Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
[MICHAEL] Good to see you.  AJ.
[MICHAEL] Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
[MICHAEL] Parkoooooour!
[MICHAEL] Who's getting married?
[MICHAEL] If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
[MICHAEL] Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
[MICHAEL] Did everybody know about this but me?
[MICHAEL] Okay... okay.
[MICHAEL] Eric likes Megan.
[MICHAEL] How do you know this?
[MICHAEL] I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
[MICHAEL] Yes
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Stanley was on your group date?
[MICHAEL] Does anybody else know about this?
[MICHAEL] Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
[MICHAEL] Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
[MICHAEL] Who?
[MICHAEL] Stanley's wife is out of town.
[MICHAEL] Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
[MICHAEL] Drugs?
[MICHAEL] Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
[MICHAEL] No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?
[MICHAEL] T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
[MICHAEL] Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
[MICHAEL] Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser...
[MICHAEL] So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
[MICHAEL] So stupid!
[MICHAEL] I know, I know.
[MICHAEL] Oh, I bet.
[MICHAEL] Wait, hold, hold, hold... so it IS true?
[MICHAEL] Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
[MICHAEL] I'm not saying... a damn thing.
[MICHAEL] You can count on me.
[MICHAEL] Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
[MICHAEL] Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.
[MICHAEL] Uh huh.  Alright?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
[MICHAEL] Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
[MICHAEL] Mm hmm.
[MICHAEL] Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.
[MICHAEL] That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.
[MICHAEL] Nowhere.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
[MICHAEL] Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
[MICHAEL] Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
[MICHAEL] The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that...
[MICHAEL] Alright, alright... you know, this is not the truth, and you can't fall on the sword this way. The real thing is that Stanley Hudson had an affair.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Jim...
[MICHAEL] Look at that!  That is the inside of your v*g1n*!
[MICHAEL] Did you pee on a stick?
[MICHAEL] You should've told me.
[MICHAEL] Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
[MICHAEL] No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.
[MICHAEL] No, no, I can do this.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
[MICHAEL] Hey, what up, Cynthia?
[MICHAEL] Yes, Oscar come on in. Close the door if you would. Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.
[MICHAEL] I'm going in for a procedure today.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, it's routine. I'm just a little bit scared.
[MICHAEL] It is a colonoscopy.
[MICHAEL] In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?
[MICHAEL] My main concern, should I have a safe word?
[MICHAEL] Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
[MICHAEL] Ho, Hol, hold on big guy, I'm gonna put it in the mail Sunday night and you'll get it Weds.
[MICHAEL] Oh right, this thing. I remember now.  What's this about?
[MICHAEL] It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Alright, do you mind if it sit this out? I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.
[MICHAEL] You and Jim are close, huh?
[MICHAEL] Hey, what do you think he and David are talking about? What do you...
[MICHAEL] Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
[MICHAEL] If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar. That's how it works. They inherit things through the breast milk.
[MICHAEL] I just don't want you to lie to me. I don't want you to ever lie to me. Have I ever lied to you?
[MICHAEL] I just don't want you to.
[MICHAEL] Sorry about that. What'd I miss?
[MICHAEL] Do not mind! Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't mind. Catch you guys on the flippity flop. Oh this... call waiting.  Yeah, uh huh, well you tell the Mayor he just lost six votes.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Nope.
[MICHAEL] No, I think they're talking about me.
[MICHAEL] How are your sales doin'?
[MICHAEL] Shhh, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on in that room, okay?
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me. How you doin'?
[MICHAEL] Yes, definitely.
[MICHAEL] Look who you're talking to.
[MICHAEL] Well I would say that my greatest talent is being the best man, woman, or child, to have ever run this branch, ever.
[MICHAEL] Permission to speak on the record?
[MICHAEL] Jim is like Big Bird. He is tall and yellow and very nice. But would I put him in charge? No, I don't think so. Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions. I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.
[MICHAEL] Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here. Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.
[MICHAEL] It's not very well written, but you get the gist.
[MICHAEL] I can just continue to run it myself.
[MICHAEL] This was Jim's idea?
[MICHAEL] Wow. Ummm, well I'd have to talk to my mother and my guy at H and R Block.
[MICHAEL] Well we did talk about how handsome you are.
[MICHAEL] Oh what a week, God. We said... I know there were certain things we said...
[MICHAEL] Hmmm, that's weird, that's weird... it's kinda weirding me out. Did you know that Lincoln's secretary was named Kennedy.
[MICHAEL] Tell you what, when you leave this office I am going to call Wallace and I am going to tell him that you should get that promotion.
[MICHAEL] Yes!
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Hey David, this is Michael Scott.  Michael Scott here.
[MICHAEL] Just wanted to talk to you about Jim Halpert. I understand that he did not receive the promotion. And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.
[MICHAEL] Absolutely,  not.  Like I said before, Jim is fantastic and he deserves this job.
[MICHAEL] Wha... here's the thing, Jim is the best man for this job, I think you should give it to him.
[MICHAEL] Well, nnnn, that... that was an anomaly. That file had been falsified. Toby Flenderson is doing drugs.
[MICHAEL] I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam,  and now I don't wanna lose the baby.
[MICHAEL] That's what she...
[MICHAEL] Kind of in the middle of something here.
[MICHAEL] I, yeah... no, I'll tell him myself. Let's both.
[MICHAEL] No, it's just us.
[MICHAEL] Oh, oh, well here he is right now.  Come in.
[MICHAEL] Well just as long as it means Jim becomes a manager.
[MICHAEL] I like that, so manager and co-manager.
[MICHAEL] Well that might be a little confusing for people because they know me as manager.
[MICHAEL] Okay everybody, I have an announcement to make... whoa do you have an announcement?
[MICHAEL] Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.
[MICHAEL] Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
[MICHAEL] What's happening to me? I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together. Jim Halpert, welcome.
[MICHAEL] No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
[MICHAEL] That is not big picture.
[MICHAEL] ... Okay.
[MICHAEL] That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
[MICHAEL] You're trying to trick me.
[MICHAEL] Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[MICHAEL] Yes?
[MICHAEL] Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
[MICHAEL] Welcome.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] Disruptive.
[MICHAEL] No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important.
[MICHAEL] Let's do.
[MICHAEL] N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
[MICHAEL] Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets...
[MICHAEL] At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
[MICHAEL] Because it's a big universe, and we're all just little, tiny specks of dust.
[MICHAEL] You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Alright. No more meetings this week.
[MICHAEL] I can be very suprising.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
[MICHAEL] Stanley, you don't need to answer that.
[MICHAEL] What do you mean by "these people"?
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
[MICHAEL] Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
[MICHAEL] What do you guys think?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people.
[MICHAEL] That is not what Wallace told us.
[MICHAEL] That is not the way I heard it.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace.  I will call David Wallace.
[MICHAEL] Or David Wallace will call us on line two. Why don't we just--
[MICHAEL] Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager.
[MICHAEL] Got it, Dave. Sounds like your classice big-picture decision.
[MICHAEL] Which is it more of?
[MICHAEL] I thought maybe we could talk after this is over.
[MICHAEL] No, it will not be. I am on top of it.
[MICHAEL] Talk to you later--  Okay, you didn't let me say good-bye.  Alright, I am looking forward to this.
[MICHAEL] I hate the fact that we have to do this together. I think we work better separately. When I am irritated and I look at you, I don't see you anymore.
[MICHAEL] All I can see is how big and gross the pores on your nose are.
[MICHAEL] No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.
[MICHAEL] Jim, don't take this the wrong way. Are you gonna take this the wrong way?
[MICHAEL] You use your brain too much.
[MICHAEL] Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
[MICHAEL] As I was saying it.
[MICHAEL] Con-- you look like a nerd.
[MICHAEL] Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
[MICHAEL] Con-- you unzip your pants, and you find that there's a calculator down there.
[MICHAEL] That will not go over well.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God! Are you gonna make another pro and con list? I'm gonna kill myself.
[MICHAEL] No! I could not do that, Jim. I can see it in your crusty little eyes that you are going to make everything perfect. If I can just think this through, if I could just think it exactly right, I can make this perfect, and then I can go down every avenue, and every avenue off of that avenue, and then another avenue.
[MICHAEL] And then another--
[MICHAEL] Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are.
[MICHAEL] Ha! That-- I am not known for that!
[MICHAEL] Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?
[MICHAEL] Ah.
[MICHAEL] Okay, here's a tough decision for you. You suck! You suck! Is that clear enough for you?!
[MICHAEL] Okay, Skippy, here we go. Why don't you run yourself out there and tell them?  You call it.
[MICHAEL] That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--
[MICHAEL] My plan-- a man-- panama.
[MICHAEL] Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise?  Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best.
[MICHAEL] Are you making a--
[MICHAEL] Toby.
[MICHAEL] Just wanted to draw a picture of him.
[MICHAEL] Alright! Who to pick?  Who to pick?
[MICHAEL] I... will skip a turn.
[MICHAEL] I need more time.
[MICHAEL] Hey, what are you guys doing in here?
[MICHAEL] How you doing?
[MICHAEL] Oh, what are you usually?
[MICHAEL] Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know.
[MICHAEL] Yes, we did.
[MICHAEL] Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] Gin.
[MICHAEL] Just pretend we're not here.
[MICHAEL] It's just a really important day for me.
[MICHAEL] Thanks.
[MICHAEL] Yes she does. Yes she does. We're all gonna go and we're gonna have a good time.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
[MICHAEL] Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
[MICHAEL] Yes. I said that yesterday.
[MICHAEL] Dwight...
[MICHAEL] No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.
[MICHAEL] This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
[MICHAEL] Get out of here.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] There's... a name.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
[MICHAEL] Is that all you have on her?
[MICHAEL] You're an idiot.
[MICHAEL] Those glasses are super dark.
[MICHAEL] Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
[MICHAEL] You did?
[MICHAEL] That was nice of you.
[MICHAEL] Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
[MICHAEL] Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
[MICHAEL] No. No. That's not how it works.
[MICHAEL] Mmm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.
[MICHAEL] Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
[MICHAEL] I'm staying in your-- Come on, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] I would do the same for you.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes... just go--
[MICHAEL] Oh. Thank God.
[MICHAEL] Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
[MICHAEL] If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] I don't have a room?
[MICHAEL] Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
[MICHAEL] Jerk.
[MICHAEL] Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
[MICHAEL] Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
[MICHAEL] You... are... kidding me.
[MICHAEL] I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
[MICHAEL] That's rude.
[MICHAEL] You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.
[MICHAEL] How ya doin'?
[MICHAEL] Nice to meet you.
[MICHAEL] Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
[MICHAEL] That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
[MICHAEL] Didn't move my lips.
[MICHAEL] Head table, where I belong.
[MICHAEL] Well, who's that one?
[MICHAEL] What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
[MICHAEL] That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
[MICHAEL] That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
[MICHAEL] That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
[MICHAEL] And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Go ahead.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--
[MICHAEL] Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.
[MICHAEL] When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.
[MICHAEL] When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
[MICHAEL] ...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.
[MICHAEL] Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
[MICHAEL] Jim.
[MICHAEL] I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
[MICHAEL] I have not found that to be the case.
[MICHAEL] Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
[MICHAEL] There's gonna be a free room?
[MICHAEL] Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
[MICHAEL] Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have s*x before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have s*x and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.
[MICHAEL] Exactly.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.
[MICHAEL] Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.
[MICHAEL] Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Ok.  That's not appropriate.  Uncool. Uncool, Dwight.  Ok. Ok. Come on. Let's go.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
[MICHAEL] They're men, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Something is wrong with you.
[MICHAEL] Is that Pam? Hey, have her come out! Have her come out! It would be like Coyote Ugly.
[MICHAEL] I love you!
[MICHAEL] Oh my God. You're not going to be able to talk back.
[MICHAEL] She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."  "And... and clip my toenails."
[MICHAEL] Now you sound like Kermit.
[MICHAEL] Hey, good morning.  It's about damn time. I haven't gone to the bathroom in a day and a half.  Oh my God, Dwight. This room is a pit.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.
[MICHAEL] She was cute. You know? She was hot. She was very hot. She made love like a tiger.
[MICHAEL] She was from Europe.
[MICHAEL] Uh-huh.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Wait a second. You're not into her? Are you kidding me?
[MICHAEL] She's Pam's best friend. You guys could double date. Swap maybe?
[MICHAEL] No... you're crazy.
[MICHAEL] She's-- okay. Do you know how hard it is to be a hygienist? You have to take x-rays. You have to scrape the plaque off of people's teeth. You have to tell kids when to spit and make sure they're not scared when the dentist comes in. It-- it--
[MICHAEL] I already have my European girlfriend.
[MICHAEL] Oh, here we go. They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need? I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special. I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.  And I have another one of them in the nude. But that one is for me.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey... He's not sitting with me either. Where are you sitting? You need a seat buddy?
[MICHAEL] Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid. Where am I gonna go?
[MICHAEL] Oh! Eww... apricot. Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--
[MICHAEL] Oh... okay. Were you saving it?
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry.  Ugh. Apricot. Made of real apes.
[MICHAEL] I came here hoping to meet somebody. You know, as you do at weddings. End up going to sleep by the vending machine. It was loud, but it was warm.
[MICHAEL] And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.
[MICHAEL] It is a terrible year for love.
[MICHAEL] I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.
[MICHAEL] Oh, wow. That sounds hilarious. I do actually.  There you go. Use it in good health.
[MICHAEL] Yes! Yes! I have so much joy... in my heart... right now. How do I look?
[MICHAEL] Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
[MICHAEL] Get out.
[MICHAEL] Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake. But you can't just go right to the selling, you need "small talk." What topics can you use for small talk?
[MICHAEL] Mmhm.
[MICHAEL] Mmhm.
[MICHAEL] Yes, what else?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"
[MICHAEL] All right...
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. God. What you people don't know about business, I could fill a book with.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec.  Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
[MICHAEL] Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
[MICHAEL] Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made.
[MICHAEL] Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
[MICHAEL] Mmhm.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
[MICHAEL] Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well.
[MICHAEL] Do your worst.
[MICHAEL] Mmhm.
[MICHAEL] Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
[MICHAEL] No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
[MICHAEL] There is no such things as monsters.
[MICHAEL] Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
[MICHAEL] I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
[MICHAEL] He did talk about a fire in the warehouse... and he also vaguely threatened me with testicular cancer.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Um it is, Grotti.
[MICHAEL] Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
[MICHAEL] I'm not gonna lock my door.
[MICHAEL] "I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business."
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
[MICHAEL] Okay, I'm calling the police.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Shh!
[MICHAEL] That's not gonna happen.
[MICHAEL] What am I supposed to do here?
[MICHAEL] I was thinking exactly the same thing.
[MICHAEL] I don't know, I don't know about that.
[MICHAEL] Hold on, hold on! Just-
[MICHAEL] All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.
[MICHAEL] Let's go, come on.  God!
[MICHAEL] Forget it! Forget it!
[MICHAEL] Oh my God!
[MICHAEL] Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
[MICHAEL] Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Well.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] That's not true.
[MICHAEL] Okay shut up.
[MICHAEL] I will have the gabba-gool.
[MICHAEL] The gabba-gool.
[MICHAEL] I don't, I don't have to have that.
[MICHAEL] Guys, guys-
[MICHAEL] That's okay.
[MICHAEL] Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad.
[MICHAEL] If the salad is on top, I send it back.
[MICHAEL] No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.
[MICHAEL] Hey, do you need any help?
[MICHAEL] He's a good mechanic.
[MICHAEL] I don't...
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay okay.
[MICHAEL] Yep, all right.
[MICHAEL] Put it down.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
[MICHAEL] I had to make a snap decision Dwight.
[MICHAEL] It was a lot of snap decisions.
[MICHAEL] Yes!
[MICHAEL] Just get in the car.
[MICHAEL] Jim?
[MICHAEL] Oh thank God.
[MICHAEL] It wasn't easy. I had to tell the hotel it was a medical emergency. I chose massive coronary, cause you told me that your Dad had a bad heart. Listen man, I, I got a problem, I think I'm in trouble with the mob. Or a major insurance carrier.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.
[MICHAEL] Okay!
[MICHAEL] Jim? Are you?
[MICHAEL] What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.
[MICHAEL] No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
[MICHAEL] No! Oh my God!
[MICHAEL] No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!
[MICHAEL] Jim?!?  Oh my God.
[MICHAEL] Oh no. Um. What about this Cash For Clunkers thing?
[MICHAEL] All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
[MICHAEL] No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
[MICHAEL] But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.
[MICHAEL] This is Scott.
[MICHAEL] Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
[MICHAEL] Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
[MICHAEL] I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
[MICHAEL] I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
[MICHAEL] You suck!
[MICHAEL] And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
[MICHAEL] How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
[MICHAEL] Doubt it.
[MICHAEL] What a tool.  What?
[MICHAEL] No. What do you mean?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
[MICHAEL] Erin?
[MICHAEL] Coffee?
[MICHAEL] Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back.
[MICHAEL] Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
[MICHAEL] Go. Any questions?
[MICHAEL] Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
[MICHAEL] It is?
[MICHAEL] They're back? Oh! Oh! Oh, Pam!
[MICHAEL] And oh, Jim...
[MICHAEL] Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
[MICHAEL] Pam's mom.
[MICHAEL] Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
[MICHAEL] About what?
[MICHAEL] Oh, big time.
[MICHAEL] She drives a green camry.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
[MICHAEL] Get the hell out of here, idiot.
[MICHAEL] I think you're underestimating Pam. I think more than anything, she wants me to be happy.
[MICHAEL] Okay, I have a good thing with the mom-
[MICHAEL] She's right on my way home from work.
[MICHAEL] I di- alright, I'll take surface streets, its- the last thing in the world I would want to do is upset Pam.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Sure. Thanks for asking.
[MICHAEL] Erin, look.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, no, it's nobody.
[MICHAEL] Hmm... no.
[MICHAEL] I don't.
[MICHAEL] I don't deserve this, guys.
[MICHAEL] No, I don't.
[MICHAEL] I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
[MICHAEL] Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here.
[MICHAEL] It is.
[MICHAEL] You want me to be happy?
[MICHAEL] Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
[MICHAEL] More than a friend, a co-worker.
[MICHAEL] It's okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Feels good.
[MICHAEL] I'm sleeping with Pam's mom. Sometimes, dinner.
[MICHAEL] That was a hit job. If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do with that particular cancer cluster. So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.
[MICHAEL] Who wants to help the world one step at a time?  Alright, good.
[MICHAEL] Alright, that's...
[MICHAEL] Alright...
[MICHAEL] Okay, I'm out of here,  see you later guys...
[MICHAEL] Ok, oh no here's an idea... conservation...
[MICHAEL] Anybody else? Who else has an idea?
[MICHAEL] Can you hold down the fort?  Hey boo!
[MICHAEL] What's it... why are you crying?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, I'll talk to her. I will... No... nobody talks to my baby that way... uh ah... yeah, I'll let you know how it goes. Alright, by pickle.
[MICHAEL] Pamela Morgan Beesly, you need to apologize to your mother right now.
[MICHAEL] For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?
[MICHAEL] Alright, in my defense...
[MICHAEL] Shut up Oscar. Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please? What is so wrong about me? I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual. Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.
[MICHAEL] Let's get back to the matter at hand.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no... no, no...
[MICHAEL] I don't like the tone here... this is a place of business, you are to listen to others, you are to give others respect, and you are to keep your personal issues out of it.
[MICHAEL] Do not talk to me that way! I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
[MICHAEL] I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am...
[MICHAEL] Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] Can I sit down for a second?
[MICHAEL] This is gonna sound weird, but I think I may be the victim of a hostile work environment with this whole Pam situation.
[MICHAEL] She brought it into the work place so I feel like it has to be dealt with here.
[MICHAEL] Really? Would you do that?
[MICHAEL] You're a good, good guy.
[MICHAEL] No... that's...
[MICHAEL] I don't... um... I can't hear your conversation.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah, yeah-okay... you're a jackass.  Hey, hey, you know what? You're just as stubborn as your mother, when you don't wanna do something you just don't do it.
[MICHAEL] You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.
[MICHAEL] Okay, do you want me to stop seeing your mom? Is that how we're gonna get past this? Cause, I will.
[MICHAEL] Well, that is not gonna happen!
[MICHAEL] Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
[MICHAEL] You know what? I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
[MICHAEL] You know what it means.
[MICHAEL] Night Erin.
[MICHAEL] Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...  ... ha ha ha.
[MICHAEL] Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
[MICHAEL] Who wants candy?
[MICHAEL] Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
[MICHAEL] They have a TCBY booth.
[MICHAEL] The same stuff you get downtown.
[MICHAEL] Do you like TCBY?
[MICHAEL] I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be fun
[MICHAEL] You should give them a call. Check that out.
[MICHAEL] Wha- what?
[MICHAEL] Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.
[MICHAEL] I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
[MICHAEL] Let me get your stroller.
[MICHAEL] No. What is his name?
[MICHAEL] Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
[MICHAEL] ...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
[MICHAEL] They are into style.
[MICHAEL] They are into appearance. We are selling success.
[MICHAEL] That's sorta secondary.
[MICHAEL] Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
[MICHAEL] It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
[MICHAEL] It rained.
[MICHAEL] Nothing. Cocoa.
[MICHAEL] Good. Yep.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?
[MICHAEL] Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
[MICHAEL] It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
[MICHAEL] No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
[MICHAEL] Not yet!
[MICHAEL] No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.
[MICHAEL] Oh. He did? What did he say?
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Thank you, Stanley.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
[MICHAEL] I know what a flounder is.
[MICHAEL] Uh...
[MICHAEL] You never said anything.
[MICHAEL] Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'
[MICHAEL] We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
[MICHAEL] Your nose?
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
[MICHAEL] Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith?
[MICHAEL] Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
[MICHAEL] It's a fish.
[MICHAEL] It could've died of natural causes. So...
[MICHAEL] Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
[MICHAEL] What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm.
[MICHAEL] No, no.
[MICHAEL] No. We are not done here. This-
[MICHAEL] No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'.
[MICHAEL] Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
[MICHAEL] I want to make fun of you right now.
[MICHAEL] No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God.
[MICHAEL] Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
[MICHAEL] It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  No. No. No. Oh, this is even worse.  Couple weeks ago I went to get a new cellphone and I wanted on of those packages where you have, you know, the friends- the five- the friends and family thing and the guys was like, 'Who are your 5 friends?' and I'm, like, 'Uh... ' I didn't even know I couldn't even think.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'. Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
[MICHAEL] Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
[MICHAEL] Is this the tape of me falling?
[MICHAEL] No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
[MICHAEL] It's alright. I can handle it.
[MICHAEL] I am a grown-up, Jim.
[MICHAEL] I don't think you froze.
[MICHAEL] Oscar's a douche.
[MICHAEL] No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome. Whoa!  Almost fell.
[MICHAEL] Morning Dwight.
[MICHAEL] No. I had a fish stick sandwich. Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches. My girlfriend didn't want hers. Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.
[MICHAEL] Well, yeah...
[MICHAEL] It worked.
[MICHAEL] I don't mind if I do.
[MICHAEL] I'm taking one for my lady friend.
[MICHAEL] Brain food. Thank you very much.
[MICHAEL] My girls. There they are.
[MICHAEL] Yeah--
[MICHAEL] I think everyone has meet Helene. Shall we?
[MICHAEL] No, that wouldn't be--
[MICHAEL] Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.
[MICHAEL] Hey--
[MICHAEL] Please, Kevin. You're fired.  Sorry, sorry. Work with a bunch of idiots. Shall we go?
[MICHAEL] Just want you to succeed Pammy. You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
[MICHAEL] Today is about family.
[MICHAEL] What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations. Oh, wait a second! You mean this one? Wow!
[MICHAEL] Not about taking credit. Let's just say we all did it.
[MICHAEL] Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place. Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Thank you. Thanks for lending me the books.
[MICHAEL] That's funny.
[MICHAEL] You're 54 years old.
[MICHAEL] You're 58 years old?
[MICHAEL] Congratulations.
[MICHAEL] That--
[MICHAEL] Helene?
[MICHAEL] I am. I'm definitely going to do it. I've already got the run and the bike thing down. Just need to learn how to swim. Come on, you in?
[MICHAEL] So it's a matter of interest. Good, okay. It's not anything you would have ever done.
[MICHAEL] Well there's no jumping in a triathlon.
[MICHAEL] You're thinking of the broad jump. Would you try-- bungee jumping?
[MICHAEL] Snowboarding?
[MICHAEL] I might.
[MICHAEL] Nothing. Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, no, no. No. It's stupid. You'd hate it. I hate it.
[MICHAEL] Yes you will.
[MICHAEL] I literally-- I put no thought into the wrapping at all. Might as well of been toilet paper.
[MICHAEL] It's not amazing... at all. It's sort of weird that I went and did that. And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.
[MICHAEL] Oh that I plagiarized I think.
[MICHAEL] Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things. It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.
[MICHAEL] That was a bunt.
[MICHAEL] Oh, just went to the bathroom.
[MICHAEL] I got thirsty.
[MICHAEL] Finish your cake, Helene.
[MICHAEL] I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible I need to tell you. I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
[MICHAEL] No it's not.
[MICHAEL] Wow. That just-- you've really grown.
[MICHAEL] Thank you Pam. And I hope you are as gracious during this next part. Helene, once again you are a wonderful person and you have lived a great life and I envy it. And I want it someday, but just in the future. You need somebody who-- who understands your references. Who is Kafkaesque? I've never-- I don't know him. There's another woman. And her name is Italy... and skydiving... and bungee jumping.
[MICHAEL] And I want kids. And you... unfortunately, have already completed that part of your journey down there.
[MICHAEL] It's not my decision. It's mother nature. And mother has very strict rules about fer--  -- tility.
[MICHAEL] Well, hobbies--
[MICHAEL] May I have a word with you in my office please?
[MICHAEL] Well, this is a work related matter.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Join me please, won't you?  I am going to give you a raise.
[MICHAEL] Because of all the good work you've done.
[MICHAEL] That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam. It's about attitude.
[MICHAEL] Do you want the raise or what?
[MICHAEL] Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.  And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.
[MICHAEL] No! No-- no I am not. Unless you want me to. DO you want me to? Cause I will. I will bribe you. No. Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing. What is it? Talk to me face. Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking. Come on! What do you want? What do you want? Do you want a million dollars? Do you want to hit me? Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or--
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oh-- okay , what? I don't-- Are you kidding?
[MICHAEL] Ye-- No. Alright. I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just--
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] See you.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Never. About what? A little-- what are you talking--
[MICHAEL] What punch?
[MICHAEL] I'm pretty sure we said slap.
[MICHAEL] I-- mmm-- I'm good.
[MICHAEL] Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
[MICHAEL] I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] She strong?
[MICHAEL] Can you stop this?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] I don't either.
[MICHAEL] Mmm-hmm. I know.
[MICHAEL] You gotta do something--
[MICHAEL] How much time do you think you'll need?
[MICHAEL] Come on, man!
[MICHAEL] You're just a bunch of voyeurs. Are you eating popcorn?
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] I know.  Okay. Alright.  Oh-- God!
[MICHAEL] Okay!  Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] So many things. I don't know. It's hard to choose.
[MICHAEL] Maybe that--
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Okay. I promise.  For the record your mom came on to me.
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Oh thank you. Thanks. I owe you one Dwight.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] What are you talking about--
[MICHAEL] Forget that.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Oh that feels better.
[MICHAEL] You did?
[MICHAEL] That sounds like it was hilarious.
[MICHAEL] Yes?
[MICHAEL] You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
[MICHAEL] Woo hoo, shout out!
[MICHAEL] Erin, do we have the journal?
[MICHAEL] Did you?
[MICHAEL] Oh, the Wall.
[MICHAEL] It's $1.99 to finish the article. I wonder what it was going to say?
[MICHAEL] No, no, that doesn't make any sense.
[MICHAEL] Oh, that sounds awful.
[MICHAEL] Oh God. Well, that's an interesting theory.
[MICHAEL] Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  Oh my God, wouldn't that be hilarious!
[MICHAEL] OK, OK. Good. I'll catch you on the flippity flip. Bye.  He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm just poopin'. You know how I be.
[MICHAEL] Crazy world. Lotta smells.
[MICHAEL] OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody. Anything new on YouTube? Doesn't even need to be good. Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins.
[MICHAEL] Monkey see, monkey do.
[MICHAEL] Monkey pee all over you.
[MICHAEL] We have a monthly staff meeting
[MICHAEL] What? Oh my God!  There has been a murder. There's been a murder in Savannah.
[MICHAEL] It is so much fun. Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it...
[MICHAEL] This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.
[MICHAEL] Tube City, you owe me one.
[MICHAEL] There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
[MICHAEL] Sandwich platters.
[MICHAEL] Baby carrots.
[MICHAEL] OK, use your imaginations.
[MICHAEL] It's not scary.
[MICHAEL] Well how do you think I feel? I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy. Every night, a different woman. Being oogled. Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
[MICHAEL] Who's Michael? I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
[MICHAEL] That is the way Southern people talk.
[MICHAEL] Delta Burke, I do declare. Now, shall we get to the mystery?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.
[MICHAEL] Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
[MICHAEL] Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
[MICHAEL] Very good, very good. Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
[MICHAEL] Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son? This here's Savannah.
[MICHAEL] No no no no no no no.  I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Are you going to believe that? That is a mis- that's a misdirection. We still don't know who the murderer is.  Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here. I can't do this myself. Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
[MICHAEL] I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon. We need to reopen this case.
[MICHAEL] No it ain't.
[MICHAEL] I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
[MICHAEL] This is not a game, this is my life. You are out of order, sir.
[MICHAEL] You are out of order.
[MICHAEL] You are-
[MICHAEL] Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now. Come on. Come on.
[MICHAEL] To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
[MICHAEL] Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
[MICHAEL] No Michael here, my name is-
[MICHAEL] No, you shut up. They need this game, Jim. Let us have this stupid little game, alright?
[MICHAEL] Detective Wallace?
[MICHAEL] Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.
[MICHAEL] No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.
[MICHAEL] A murder, you say? I do declare.
[MICHAEL] Get in there!
[MICHAEL] On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
[MICHAEL] We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
[MICHAEL] One, two, three..
[MICHAEL] I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.
[MICHAEL] Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
[MICHAEL] Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
[MICHAEL] Well, could you condense it please?
[MICHAEL] It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
[MICHAEL] They sent a limo.
[MICHAEL] Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
[MICHAEL] Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.
[MICHAEL] Mmm... whoa.
[MICHAEL] Definitely.
[MICHAEL] Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
[MICHAEL] Who's playing with the button?
[MICHAEL] I will have to answer.
[MICHAEL] No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.'  I won't say that. I'll something like that.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my god. This is it.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hi.
[MICHAEL] Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.
[MICHAEL] Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -
[MICHAEL] See you later.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Hello.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
[MICHAEL] It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege.
[MICHAEL] Ah.  Your eminence.
[MICHAEL] What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
[MICHAEL] Rock and roll.
[MICHAEL] This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
[MICHAEL] We're going bankrupt, you think?  They are really angry.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen. That's not gonna happen. We'll be back with some answers.  I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -
[MICHAEL] Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  45 points. It's a 45 day/45 point. One point per day. We get the 45 points we are back in business.  And you can take that to the bank.  And Limo Lady, we are going completely carbon neutral.  I love you, New York!  You. You.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
[MICHAEL] We tell them the plan, right?
[MICHAEL] Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.
[MICHAEL] Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.
[MICHAEL] I am the guy who roused that crowd.
[MICHAEL] Got them on their feet.
[MICHAEL] They were so happy down there.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm texting him, so.
[MICHAEL] It's done.
[MICHAEL] Tell them what you told me. This is genius.
[MICHAEL] Tell them about the cash flow and the dumping of properties and - this is all -
[MICHAEL] It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
[MICHAEL] That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better.
[MICHAEL] O-kay. Oh... hey, hey.  What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] Wow, man. That -
[MICHAEL] That was embarrassing.
[MICHAEL] For me, too. You embarrassed me.
[MICHAEL] Well, that was a waste of a text. Let's get down to brass tacks. I think that we might be in trouble. We don't seem to have a plan so I'm thinking I go down there. Maybe rattle off a few jokes. Congressman could follow.
[MICHAEL] Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, Have a seat.
[MICHAEL] Okay, right there is the problem. There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
[MICHAEL] I have it on good authority that you said the following.  Can you read that back to me?
[MICHAEL] Mmm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand."
[MICHAEL] You can't be a baby in the office. It makes me look like I hire babies.
[MICHAEL] Okay, who said that?
[MICHAEL] Well, thank you... thank you a lot. And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.
[MICHAEL] You're welcome, baby.
[MICHAEL] Keep.
[MICHAEL] I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
[MICHAEL] Keep.
[MICHAEL] For what?
[MICHAEL] Oh okay. I don't know how those got on there...
[MICHAEL] Must be hackers.
[MICHAEL] What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
[MICHAEL] Worse than that.
[MICHAEL] Lurk much?  I miss Pam.
[MICHAEL] Is that what we're going for now? "okay?" We used to go for "pretty good."
[MICHAEL] Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better. I'm not in this for the trophies, but...
[MICHAEL] Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.
[MICHAEL] It would look good, on my mantle.
[MICHAEL] There you are. I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
[MICHAEL] To change lives.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, okay. Call the school, cancel. I can't go through with this.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] I'm not a bad person, I bring good news. Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college. Okay, all right.
[MICHAEL] Would you come with me? You know, like old times, instead of...
[MICHAEL] Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
[MICHAEL] Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?
[MICHAEL] Good to see you. Where's your saxaphone?
[MICHAEL] Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
[MICHAEL] Well, you didn't even hear it.
[MICHAEL] Oh, good.
[MICHAEL] Sure.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah.
[MICHAEL] No, not at all. Nope, come on.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Wow!
[MICHAEL] Oh, God. Oh, God.
[MICHAEL] All right. Wow. Um, I am never going to forget today. Not a chance. I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today. Who here has done something stupid in their lives? Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "A" gym and "B" gym, that sort of thing? Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay. Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share. Ummm.  Should we go?
[MICHAEL] Ah. All right. I came here today because I promised you tuition and tuition is very valuable. But you know what's invaluable is intuition. You know what that is? That is the ability to know when something is about to happen. Does anybody out there have intuition? Know what's gonna happen next? Nobody? Okay, you're going to make me say it. All right, I am so proud of all of you. Derrick, and Lefevre, and Ben, and Ayana, and Mikela, and Nikki and Jason, and... I'm sorry, okay, sorry spacing, your name?
[MICHAEL] Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition. Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition. I'm so, so sorry.
[MICHAEL] I lied to myself too. I'm not a millionaire. I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close. And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30. Maybe by my 50s, I don't know. I wanted to pay for your education. I really did. It was my dream. Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams. My dream was in the right place.
[MICHAEL] Okay, hold on. Hold on. Now I can't pay for your college. But you don't have to go to class to be in class. Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience. And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.  Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
[MICHAEL] Erin, can you give us a second?
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] What can I do?
[MICHAEL] I can give you an extra laptop battery. Not everyone took one. How about this? If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
[MICHAEL] Really? Wow. That's over $200 a year.
[MICHAEL] For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each. I'm going to date them one year apart. Now, you are to use one check a year. And please call me before you cash the check? Cause I've got monies to move around.
[MICHAEL] That's a lot of zeroes.
[MICHAEL] Please stop. 15 lives. I destroyed 15 young lives today.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] You're what, like, 12?
[MICHAEL] I think you're doing a great job.
[MICHAEL] What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I just sort've had a feeling about him. I have a feeling about you too.
[MICHAEL] What the hell is going on?
[MICHAEL] Phyllis?
[MICHAEL] Take it back. That is absurd.
[MICHAEL] No? No! Jim! Come on!
[MICHAEL] It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
[MICHAEL] Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
[MICHAEL] No it's not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, what's your name?
[MICHAEL] Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
[MICHAEL] Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God.
[MICHAEL] What would you like for Christmas little boy?
[MICHAEL] What did you think was going to happen?
[MICHAEL] All right, just say "some toys" please.
[MICHAEL] Damn it Kevin, come on.
[MICHAEL] Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God!
[MICHAEL] Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
[MICHAEL] Come on, come on.
[MICHAEL] Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here!
[MICHAEL] Just sit down!
[MICHAEL] Yup. Ryan and I are just having some fun!
[MICHAEL] Whoop! Okay, what?
[MICHAEL] Okay. You know what Jim, there are two Santas in the room. Things get ruthless!
[MICHAEL] Do you understand, you forced my hand?
[MICHAEL] Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why don't "we" take a vote on it?
[MICHAEL] Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
[MICHAEL] No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
[MICHAEL] I'll get some punch. That looks delicious.
[MICHAEL] Oh the Anti-Christ!
[MICHAEL] Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
[MICHAEL] Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
[MICHAEL] Uh oh, what's Dwight gonna get? What is iiiit?
[MICHAEL] Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?
[MICHAEL] Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.
[MICHAEL] I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up.
[MICHAEL] That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] Andy had Erin.
[MICHAEL] What? Was I not supposed to say it?  What? Turn it back on.
[MICHAEL] David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as.
[MICHAEL] I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
[MICHAEL] I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Really? What's going on?
[MICHAEL] What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
[MICHAEL] Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
[MICHAEL] What does that mean?
[MICHAEL] Well, can't Alan protect you?
[MICHAEL] All of us?
[MICHAEL] Oh my God.
[MICHAEL] That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
[MICHAEL] You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some... jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
[MICHAEL] I don't want to say. But, "it's fun to stay at the -"
[MICHAEL] Mmm, mm mm mm.
[MICHAEL] It's not... Nevermind. Nothing.
[MICHAEL] I didn't say anything!
[MICHAEL] We're going out of business!
[MICHAEL] David told me on the phone. David told me.
[MICHAEL] Earlier today.
[MICHAEL] He said, we have been sold.
[MICHAEL] Dwight! Jesus!
[MICHAEL] David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
[MICHAEL] It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
[MICHAEL] I'll call him. I'll call David.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
[MICHAEL] It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott.
[MICHAEL] Stephanie could you hop off please?
[MICHAEL] David!
[MICHAEL] David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
[MICHAEL] David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
[MICHAEL] Well I think we're past that now.
[MICHAEL] We're not fired?
[MICHAEL] Yeah!  It's a Christmas miracle!
[MICHAEL] Woo hoo!
[MICHAEL] Huh. Well, maybe those will help.
[MICHAEL] I'd like to make a wish.
[MICHAEL] I would like an Xbox, and a TV that's compatible with an Xbox. And, I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] You called Bob?
[MICHAEL] Come on! Phyllis!
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Oh God. Get a room Santas!
[MICHAEL] I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
[MICHAEL] What is the world's largest ocean?
[MICHAEL] Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
[MICHAEL] That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant.
[MICHAEL] Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit -
[MICHAEL] - since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
[MICHAEL] They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
[MICHAEL] No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God.
[MICHAEL] - follow me this way. I'll introduce you to the crack HR rep that you requested. I give you Toby Flenderson. Have fun, you two.
[MICHAEL] Stuff. I love stuff.
[MICHAEL] HR stuff?  HR Pufnstuf. Right up my alley.  What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
[MICHAEL] Ah.
[MICHAEL] Talkin' bout, uh, what?
[MICHAEL] Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
[MICHAEL] Oh, time and resources.
[MICHAEL] No. No. No. No. No. No. Respectfully, Toby, no. No. This company does not waste time or resources, ever.
[MICHAEL] That's, that is true.
[MICHAEL] Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?
[MICHAEL] Just - sh -
[MICHAEL] Shut -
[MICHAEL] Shut up. Shut up.
[MICHAEL] So check out how we live
[MICHAEL] They call it Scranton!
[MICHAEL] The Electric City. Scranton!
[MICHAEL] The Electric City. Lazy Scranton, the Electric City. They call it that 'cause of the electricity. The city's laid out from East to West and our public parks are libraries are truly the best. Call poison control if you're bitten by a spider.
[MICHAEL] Plenty of space in the parking lot.
[MICHAEL] Snack attack time.
[MICHAEL] We like Cugino's
[MICHAEL] They call it Scranton!
[MICHAEL] The Electric City. Scranton!
[MICHAEL] The Electric City. Scranton!
[MICHAEL] The Electric City. Scranton!
[MICHAEL] The Electric City. Scranton!
[MICHAEL] Ugh.
[MICHAEL] It's from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me.
[MICHAEL] Cool. What next?
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
[MICHAEL] And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
[MICHAEL] Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
[MICHAEL] Why do I have to explain everything?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
[MICHAEL] Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert.
[MICHAEL] In training.
[MICHAEL] We're very excited too, aren't we guys? Right?
[MICHAEL] We have a little song prepared for you.
[MICHAEL] Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
[MICHAEL] Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
[MICHAEL] Saber.
[MICHAEL] Perfect.
[MICHAEL] We'll still get to use the little cups, though, right?
[MICHAEL] I don't know what they're made of.
[MICHAEL] You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.
[MICHAEL] All of them.
[MICHAEL] So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
[MICHAEL] Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
[MICHAEL] Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
[MICHAEL] Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
[MICHAEL] Ok. I feel very strongly that you can't just come in here and change everything that people have been doing forever. Is Christian Slater back there? Because... he knows. He'd know what to do.
[MICHAEL] I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
[MICHAEL] I hope you're not busy doing something.
[MICHAEL] You sure?
[MICHAEL] You look great too.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
[MICHAEL] Hey. Wow.
[MICHAEL] Really loud.
[MICHAEL] Can I just stay here and never go back?
[MICHAEL] Oh, man. How much time do you have?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...
[MICHAEL] I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Exactly. What are you thinking?
[MICHAEL] It is a tough one.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. But one would be good.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay.
[MICHAEL] No, I think it is-
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] The what?
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay.
[MICHAEL] Like it.
[MICHAEL] Bye now.
[MICHAEL] Thanks for having me.
[MICHAEL] But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you.
[MICHAEL] No. This is my toast. I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it.
[MICHAEL] Here's my toast. Orange juice is in here. And, like Saber, it is from Florida, and it is good.
[MICHAEL] Here's the toast. I'm gonna do it now. Raise your container to us and to Sabre.
[MICHAEL] Mm. Wow. That is metallicy. Ugh. That's like drinking a battery. Ah, really gets you in the fillings, doesn't it? Okay, anyway, welcome.
[MICHAEL] Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America! I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.
[MICHAEL] Okey doke.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] No.  We're trying to look it up right now.
[MICHAEL] Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] That's it!
[MICHAEL] Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.
[MICHAEL] Okay, put it on my card.
[MICHAEL] Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
[MICHAEL] Whoa, whoa!
[MICHAEL] And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
[MICHAEL] Forget the question...
[MICHAEL] I humbly accept the management position.
[MICHAEL] Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of folk: those who ain't, and those who are knee-high on a grasshopper. Which type ain't you ain't? Ya'll come back now.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] No, we know. Texas!
[MICHAEL] I could manage my way around that.
[MICHAEL] I will try to manage my excitement!
[MICHAEL] Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] What? Really?
[MICHAEL] Wow!
[MICHAEL] What are you reading?
[MICHAEL] Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
[MICHAEL] Why, is there an untapped gay market?
[MICHAEL] ...Where did you get that information.
[MICHAEL] Manuel who?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.
[MICHAEL] No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
[MICHAEL] I'm turning myself in right now!
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
[MICHAEL] How is that possible?
[MICHAEL] No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales.
[MICHAEL] Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
[MICHAEL] Well, okay...
[MICHAEL] No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?
[MICHAEL] You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
[MICHAEL] No, this is geological.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me?
[MICHAEL] And you guys are okay with this?
[MICHAEL] Oh my God.
[MICHAEL] You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
[MICHAEL] I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
[MICHAEL] We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
[MICHAEL] Lethal Weapon?
[MICHAEL] What? What I'm saying...
[MICHAEL] And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me.
[MICHAEL] Alright!
[MICHAEL] Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
[MICHAEL] Oh, oh, oh! Contraption! She's contrapting! Okay, you know what? I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why. I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania. I gassed up the car...
[MICHAEL] Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
[MICHAEL] Happy to do it. Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
[MICHAEL] Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yuck! TMI! How was it? I don't want to know. Tell me later. Let's go! Let's go! Hospital!
[MICHAEL] Shut up, Nick. What a weird thing to say. Weird I.T. nerd. Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no, no. You know what? You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
[MICHAEL] Distractions are good! That means conference room, five minutes! No, no, five seconds! Right now, right now! Conference room! Topic, potpourri! Let's go!
[MICHAEL] I will allow that.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Does anybody have anything? Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
[MICHAEL] Yes, Phyl?
[MICHAEL] Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
[MICHAEL] That sounds good! Do you need some music, or...? Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, happy times. Come on. Let's have happy times.
[MICHAEL] Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor. And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor. Erin, read the first one.
[MICHAEL] Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples. Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
[MICHAEL] Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
[MICHAEL] Okay, the opposite of that?
[MICHAEL] Ooh, someone's freakin'.
[MICHAEL] I think he is.
[MICHAEL] Pam, Pam! Okay, alright, okay, it's time. Time to go to the hospital. Somebody get Jim, please! Is it midnight yet?
[MICHAEL] 4:35. Alright, almost made it. Almost made it. Too bad you didn't have s*x like seven and a half hours later. But you had to have the afternoon delight. I understand. Sometimes you have to go for it. Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
[MICHAEL] We can do...
[MICHAEL] Oh. What? You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
[MICHAEL] What is October feast?
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay, Jim. I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
[MICHAEL] That's right, let's do this.
[MICHAEL] Let's go, Pam. Yeah, I think we should head out.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding?
[MICHAEL] You can do this. You can do this.
[MICHAEL] I'm scared, too.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] We're going to have a baby.
[MICHAEL] Let's do that.
[MICHAEL] Two minutes apart.
[MICHAEL] It's okay.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know, I know. It went by too soon.
[MICHAEL] We're okay, Jim! Okay, Pamela. You know what time it is?
[MICHAEL] You're not going to. You know where you're going?
[MICHAEL] Yes, you are. And you know what you're going to have?
[MICHAEL] Yes! We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
[MICHAEL] No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive. I will drive you. Check! Got it.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Go bag! Where's my go bag? Where's my go bag?
[MICHAEL] You are telling me now that there is nothing in it. Okay, great! Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
[MICHAEL] Thank you! Wish me luck!
[MICHAEL] Come on, Stanley! Okay. We're going now!
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no! Out, out! Idiot.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Geesh, Dwight!
[MICHAEL] What!?
[MICHAEL] Where?
[MICHAEL] By the bushes?
[MICHAEL] Okay, go, go, go, go!
[MICHAEL] Okay, just breathe... She? You found out? Come on, guys. I wanted to be surprised.
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] I'm texting about you, okay!?
[MICHAEL] Guys, guys! Stop fighting, come on. Come on. Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer? Right? Okay, you know what? I am all over this. Here we go.  Ready?
[MICHAEL] Hello, Dwight. Pam left her iPod at her house. I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital. We need it yesterday.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Do you have everything, guys?
[MICHAEL] Okay, alright.
[MICHAEL] Dunder-Mifflin. It's okay.  I just did.
[MICHAEL] Where is my little nibblet? Halpert, room D1. Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Okay, not yet, not yet. I'm going to go wash my eyes.
[MICHAEL] I think it's going to be any minute now.
[MICHAEL] Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God. Go, go, go! Are you insane? Alright.
[MICHAEL] You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
[MICHAEL] Okay. You can't smoke anywhere these days.
[MICHAEL] Eleven pounds...
[MICHAEL] Thank you! Thank you!
[MICHAEL] Hello. Oh, good for you. I worry about you.
[MICHAEL] Love you, as a friend.
[MICHAEL] Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm. Oh. Ooh, wow. Michael. Michael.
[MICHAEL] Who else here is single?
[MICHAEL] I am offering up my services to you all. You saw what I did with Pam and Jim. I can help you, too.
[MICHAEL] Okay, show of hands. Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?  Who else? Come on! People, I know models!
[MICHAEL] Ha ha, you got that right! Meredith? Come on, you're obviously single.
[MICHAEL] What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
[MICHAEL] I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
[MICHAEL] Okay, hold on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth. Why don't you guys get to know each other? Maybe have lunch together?
[MICHAEL] Good!
[MICHAEL] Sure. Kevin, please leave.
[MICHAEL] Bye.
[MICHAEL] Okay. This is going to kill Kevin.
[MICHAEL] I'm not so sure. Kevin has an enormous heart. Literally, he has an elephant heart. He had a transplant when he was seventeen. Had some problems, blah blah blah.
[MICHAEL] Just don't let him sit on you... I'm kidding. You'll have fun. It'll be good. It'll be good. There he is. Go to him.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God, this is agonizing. Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
[MICHAEL] Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin. And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Lynn was as hot as Erin.
[MICHAEL] This isn't about me, and that is debatable. And I have a personality, where as you... Yes, Andy?
[MICHAEL] Kev... Nice. Going.
[MICHAEL] Morning, honey-pile.
[MICHAEL] It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
[MICHAEL] Yes it is!
[MICHAEL] No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
[MICHAEL] Mm, that sounds great, actually.
[MICHAEL] That is a great idea JB.
[MICHAEL] Oscar, homosexual accountant.
[MICHAEL] Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
[MICHAEL] Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
[MICHAEL] Well, I am heading down there.
[MICHAEL] How about July 4th weekend?
[MICHAEL] I did!
[MICHAEL] You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
[MICHAEL] All right, everybody, just try to put a brave face on.
[MICHAEL] No is not an option.
[MICHAEL] All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
[MICHAEL] I'll be over there.
[MICHAEL] A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
[MICHAEL] Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
[MICHAEL] How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
[MICHAEL] Okay. All right.
[MICHAEL] Hey there. So I think I'm done. Gonna head out. Unless you want to chat. Like we were doing earlier.
[MICHAEL] Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so.
[MICHAEL] Right. What?
[MICHAEL] Mm. mm. Oh well.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
[MICHAEL] How you doing stud? You already there?
[MICHAEL] How's the lady situation?
[MICHAEL] Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Maybe next year.
[MICHAEL] How late do we have to work tonight?
[MICHAEL] Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
[MICHAEL] There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
[MICHAEL] I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Oh -hoh! All right.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there?
[MICHAEL] Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
[MICHAEL] I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
[MICHAEL] In my condo complex.
[MICHAEL] I am flipping out, man. I mean, you remember my idea for the fourth Pirates movie.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl?
[MICHAEL] Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim.
[MICHAEL] No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. Screw you, Halpert. You know, it's not easy getting excited about stuff. Remember how you felt when you thought you'd seen Roger Clemens?
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know.
[MICHAEL] I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
[MICHAEL] Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meeting's not over.
[MICHAEL] No sales topic per se.
[MICHAEL] Dwight?
[MICHAEL] I would like your undivided attention, please.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] M-hmm.
[MICHAEL] Is that all you have to say to me?
[MICHAEL] Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
[MICHAEL] You writing your memoirs over there?
[MICHAEL] Well, it's a pretty big check.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people.
[MICHAEL] I'm just saying, that -
[MICHAEL] Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. That's -
[MICHAEL] You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
[MICHAEL] The sales department smashed my sandwich.
[MICHAEL] You don't get it.
[MICHAEL] That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Thank you very much.
[MICHAEL] Ah, just the stupid leads.
[MICHAEL] Alright. Then I guess I should give them out. Hold on. You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that I have something that you want. You guys are acting like you own this place. And you don't. Not even Sabre owns this place. It's a rental. I'm kind of sick of the attitude around here. I'm sick of the cocky walk, I am sick of you throwing your paycheck in my face, I am sick of your uppity attitude, Jim... I think I am not going to give these to you.
[MICHAEL] Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
[MICHAEL] They act like I have no power.
[MICHAEL] Hmm. Well, if that is what I am required to do, I will do exactly that.
[MICHAEL] Exactly that.
[MICHAEL] Exactly that.
[MICHAEL] - and to King Meredith!
[MICHAEL] And to King Angela!  Because today we are all kings. And queens .
[MICHAEL] I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Oh, right, those are clues. And within each clue is a lesson. You learn a lesson, and then you find a lead. The leads are scattered all over the industrial park. I am trying to make your kids respect you. Because a father needs to respect his boss, and kids don't respect the father who doesn't respect the boss. Do you understand that line of logic?
[MICHAEL] I do understand it.
[MICHAEL] Or is it?
[MICHAEL] Well, bigshot, 'If you want to find your leads, go to the man who never breathes'.
[MICHAEL] Wait. What day is today?
[MICHAEL] Oh my god. Oh my god  oh my god, no, no no, hey, hey  wait, wait!
[MICHAEL] Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump."
[MICHAEL] Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you -
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories!
[MICHAEL] You can.
[MICHAEL] Okay fine, I get it. I'll just go by myself.
[MICHAEL] You know, Dwight, there was a time when you'd be pinching yourself to have the opportunity to look through a dump with me.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.
[MICHAEL] Since when do you care about money? When I first met you, you were a wide-eyed innocent.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Assistant to the managed him -
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] You think you would have done better without me? Really?
[MICHAEL] Wow. Ohhhkay. Man. When I think about all the time I wasted being your friend - I shouldn't have been hanging out watching karate movies with you -
[MICHAEL] You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies -
[MICHAEL] That's my wife you're talking about, man.
[MICHAEL] If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you.
[MICHAEL] No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  No, time out, time out.  Time in!
[MICHAEL] Don't even think about that
[MICHAEL] We're never going to find those leads, are we?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, she does - she loves purple.  Does it stink?
[MICHAEL] Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would read:
[MICHAEL] In the dump.
[MICHAEL] No! Better!
[MICHAEL] I'm going to give Erin $15.
[MICHAEL] A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
[MICHAEL] She's kind of a rube.
[MICHAEL] Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
[MICHAEL] I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
[MICHAEL] Ugh.
[MICHAEL] Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...
[MICHAEL] Okay, well, we'll figure something.
[MICHAEL] Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Ahhh.
[MICHAEL] Right.
[MICHAEL] An age or month?
[MICHAEL] So how are things going with Andy?
[MICHAEL] Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
[MICHAEL] Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
[MICHAEL] I don't think he is the best dresser. Reminds me of Easter.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having s*x with somebody else.
[MICHAEL] They were engaged, so...  Okay, you know what, sir?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm. Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now.
[MICHAEL] You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..
[MICHAEL] No. No. No.
[MICHAEL] Stop talking.
[MICHAEL] Oh God.
[MICHAEL] Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
[MICHAEL] You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
[MICHAEL] No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
[MICHAEL] Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing.
[MICHAEL] Well, yeah, yes. But I still feel sorry. You know what, I wouldn't worry about Angela. She doesn't hold a candle to you, Erin. She's old enough to be your mom for one thing. And she's, like, three feet tall. And she wears pioneer women clothing. And I don't think she's ever pooped in her life. And Andy, you know, come on. Andy, his butt looks big in those khakis.
[MICHAEL] You said butt.
[MICHAEL] Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is him: "Hey! Hey Scott!"
[MICHAEL] Oh, oh, I was just watching that. Did you do that, man? "Oscar. I am the Count." Nailed him. Nailed him.  Good work Cookie Monster.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
[MICHAEL] Ha ha! Buenos dias, Dwight!
[MICHAEL] Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
[MICHAEL] Damn it.  Ah, Angelo.
[MICHAEL] Yo soy Cancun.
[MICHAEL] Can you smell the power of the Halperts? Power couple.
[MICHAEL] I went with the people I thought would put the best face on the company.
[MICHAEL] Did somebody order a hooker over here?
[MICHAEL] Hi. How are you?
[MICHAEL] Hi.
[MICHAEL] Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
[MICHAEL] Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
[MICHAEL] Uh, yes, uh, the sale is on now through May.
[MICHAEL] Okay, I have more of them.
[MICHAEL] And that would be a display  of the crisp, gorgeous black.
[MICHAEL] Ryan.
[MICHAEL] And that's it. That's me. That's who I am.
[MICHAEL] Oh, thanks.  You're not bad, either.
[MICHAEL] Hmm.
[MICHAEL] Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
[MICHAEL] Oh really, Jim? What about Pam? And you did a heck of a lot more than kiss. Maybe this could be my Pam.
[MICHAEL] So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right?
[MICHAEL] Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
[MICHAEL] I think we could.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well sometimes... sometimes it makes financial sense to lose money, right? Like for tax purposes.
[MICHAEL] Why don't you run them again?
[MICHAEL] If she is, it's working.
[MICHAEL] Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints?
[MICHAEL] I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
[MICHAEL] They're good
[MICHAEL] Sure.
[MICHAEL] Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
[MICHAEL] Okay. What do you think?
[MICHAEL] Andy?
[MICHAEL] Okay, some for, some against.
[MICHAEL] Pam?
[MICHAEL] Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yeah it was nice to do business with you, too.
[MICHAEL] I don't know. I think so.
[MICHAEL] Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
[MICHAEL] Thank you so much.
[MICHAEL] Mmm.
[MICHAEL] Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have...
[MICHAEL] All right. All right. Bye.
[MICHAEL] And have a good elevator ride.
[MICHAEL] Oh, what's that out there?
[MICHAEL] I don't know. I don't know. Can't really trust my feelings anymore.
[MICHAEL] She suckered you too.
[MICHAEL] Was it the cleavage?
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] God. She left this here?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I know. I know.
[MICHAEL] I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.
[MICHAEL] Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
[MICHAEL] Who?
[MICHAEL] About what?
[MICHAEL] No, no. No.
[MICHAEL] No...
[MICHAEL] Really?! Oh, that's great. That's such good news. I did it!  I kissed. We kissed.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette  We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
[MICHAEL] Get back to work, Dwight. Please.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay, you get out of here, big dog.  Ah, no, no, no, no. You guys sit down. I need ideas.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, Stanley doesn't help with anything. Come on. Shout 'em out, shout 'em out.
[MICHAEL] Oh!
[MICHAEL] That's fun.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] We actually went to the Poconos last Tuesday. We headed up there, we went to a little Chinese bistro, um, P.F. Chang's.
[MICHAEL] Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono," you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI.
[MICHAEL] You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real World: Scranton. Oh my God, this is super weird. When Ryan had two girlfriends, he used to take me to some diner in Hazelton just so the other girl wouldn't see.
[MICHAEL] You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
[MICHAEL] ... and... we had s*x, too.
[MICHAEL] How?
[MICHAEL] How do I not make any more of it?
[MICHAEL] All right.  And she won't say, "I love you."
[MICHAEL] Nine dates. I said it on the second date.
[MICHAEL] No, no...
[MICHAEL] Run what?
[MICHAEL] Why didn't you just say that, Pam?
[MICHAEL] Well, that's easy for you to say. You have a bad imagination. It's stupid. I live in a fantasy world.
[MICHAEL] Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit.
[MICHAEL] That's what makes it so wrong.
[MICHAEL] I want someone to follow Donna. I want her tailed. I need the name of a good private investigator.
[MICHAEL] This is you. How much do you charge?
[MICHAEL] I'll give you $50. Money's no object.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives.
[MICHAEL] It's comfort food, all right?  God.
[MICHAEL] I know. Well, I hope you're right. We'll see what Dwight says.
[MICHAEL] Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
[MICHAEL] It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok.
[MICHAEL] God, this is so disgusting.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] That's not true.  You're right, I ruin everything. And I've known some wonderful women. Holly, Carol, Jan.
[MICHAEL] Helene?
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] No, what happened with Donna?
[MICHAEL] Ugh!
[MICHAEL] No. No! Are you sure?
[MICHAEL] Who eats eight protein bars?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well, I am just glad this is all over.
[MICHAEL] What? No, she didn't say that.
[MICHAEL] I am not paying for that membership.
[MICHAEL] No, I like the attention. Is she here yet?
[MICHAEL] That's her?
[MICHAEL] Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Right.  Okay, I'll talk to you later.
[MICHAEL] I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
[MICHAEL] Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want.
[MICHAEL] If you wanna dump me, I totally get it.
[MICHAEL] Well, you are boner-ific.
[MICHAEL] ...poop my pants.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
[MICHAEL] We are?
[MICHAEL] Wow.  That's exciting.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Well it can wait. It can wait.
[MICHAEL] Jim is her husband.
[MICHAEL] And they are having problems, so sh...
[MICHAEL] Good in bed.
[MICHAEL] Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
[MICHAEL] Okay, weirdo.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
[MICHAEL] God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
[MICHAEL] I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him.
[MICHAEL] I have to hear it from her.
[MICHAEL] I need to have her tell me herself. Right?
[MICHAEL] I need to have her say...
[MICHAEL] I need to say, "What the hell is that? What the hell is that?"
[MICHAEL] No, God! No, no, oh, my God!
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay. Okay.
[MICHAEL] Wouldn't that be fun?
[MICHAEL] How about Thursday?
[MICHAEL] I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
[MICHAEL] Oh, really? 'cause I was thinking we could go to this concert. Spice Girls are opening for Weird Al. Front row. It'd be a great, great concert.
[MICHAEL] Oh okay. Well, maybe I could stop by.
[MICHAEL] Nope, that's Tuesday.
[MICHAEL] You're cheating. You're cheating on me.
[MICHAEL] Pam told me.
[MICHAEL] The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it?
[MICHAEL] I'm the mistress?
[MICHAEL] You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
[MICHAEL] You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
[MICHAEL] Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
[MICHAEL] Okay, alright.
[MICHAEL] I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
[MICHAEL] Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
[MICHAEL] I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
[MICHAEL] Toby, just do it! God!
[MICHAEL] Good work.
[MICHAEL] Morning everyone.
[MICHAEL] Hello!
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think.
[MICHAEL] Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well... that's random. I will dig into those later.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
[MICHAEL] That... exists?
[MICHAEL] Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
[MICHAEL] Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
[MICHAEL] Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
[MICHAEL] Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
[MICHAEL] I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
[MICHAEL] He is never gonna find out. He is a high school baseball coach. He wakes up early. He goes to bed early. Look at how long it took for him to find out.  It was right under his nose. I had to tell him.
[MICHAEL] I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
[MICHAEL] On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
[MICHAEL] Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
[MICHAEL] You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
[MICHAEL] Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy.
[MICHAEL] Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him.
[MICHAEL] I am Beyonce always.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I am.
[MICHAEL] I would love that.
[MICHAEL] I have work to do.
[MICHAEL] Let's go.  I can't wait to see this jerk who is making me cheat on his wife. I should punch him in the nose for what he's making me do to her.
[MICHAEL] All right, Andy, please.
[MICHAEL] Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
[MICHAEL] Right there. The coach!
[MICHAEL] Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base?
[MICHAEL] All right. Can you just-- can you just act normal for a second, please?
[MICHAEL] You have no idea what you're talking about.
[MICHAEL] You don't. No, no.
[MICHAEL] You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit."
[MICHAEL] Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
[MICHAEL] Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] No. God. You go talk to him.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no.
[MICHAEL] I'm good. Oh, my God.
[MICHAEL] Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
[MICHAEL] Well, that was not at all what I expected. Hoo hoo! Whoo. My heart's still racing. I just looked a man in the eyes and I shook his hand. All the time I was thinking, "I'm sleeping with your wife." And you know who does that? James freakin' Bond.
[MICHAEL] Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
[MICHAEL] You love it. There ya go.
[MICHAEL] Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks.
[MICHAEL] Well, then it wouldn't be the first time I stole something away from Coach Shane.
[MICHAEL] I did.
[MICHAEL] No. We just talked. He's very nice.
[MICHAEL] It did not.
[MICHAEL] Isn't it?
[MICHAEL] I'm awful, aren't I?
[MICHAEL] I'm an awful guy! Ooh!
[MICHAEL] I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for.
[MICHAEL] I don't care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
[MICHAEL] You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I noticed that.
[MICHAEL] Nope.
[MICHAEL] Okay.  Phyllis. Okay. Look at me.  Phyllis, look at--  okay, that's...  All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
[MICHAEL] Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
[MICHAEL] Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
[MICHAEL] Nobody better try to stop me. Good.
[MICHAEL] Yes?
[MICHAEL] Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
[MICHAEL] OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
[MICHAEL] Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
[MICHAEL] Please.
[MICHAEL] Jo! We were not expecting you!
[MICHAEL] Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
[MICHAEL] Absolutely. Anyone who talked to the press, please raise your hand.
[MICHAEL] There is no reason for anyone here to sign this, because I know everything there is to know about these people. I know when their birthdays are, I know what their favorite kind of cake is, I know what color streamers they like...
[MICHAEL] Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda.
[MICHAEL] Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can.
[MICHAEL] I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
[MICHAEL] About talking to the press?
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm.
[MICHAEL] I don't believe you.
[MICHAEL] That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.
[MICHAEL] Okay, I believe you, I believe you.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, no, no...
[MICHAEL] Oh my god. Was she cute?
[MICHAEL] Oh, god, Darryl!
[MICHAEL] I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
[MICHAEL] No, you know what's messed up? This situation all up in here is what's messed up! We need to brainstorm, we need to get out of this! Brain hurricane. Come on, think.
[MICHAEL] What do we got?
[MICHAEL] It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.
[MICHAEL] Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.
[MICHAEL] No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
[MICHAEL] Just don't say no.
[MICHAEL] That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
[MICHAEL] Okay. You can count on me.
[MICHAEL] I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] Well, deal with this.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] I have rights.
[MICHAEL] I am not going to tell you anything.
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
[MICHAEL] Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
[MICHAEL] And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
[MICHAEL] Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
[MICHAEL] Hmm, hmm.
[MICHAEL] You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
[MICHAEL] I, I surely do, and don't call me honey.  You were playing too.
[MICHAEL] That was fun.
[MICHAEL] Thanks. Today helped.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua.
[MICHAEL] He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though.  Ah! It's not cappuccino.
[MICHAEL] It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
[MICHAEL] Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
[MICHAEL] To get some ice cream for everybody. It's national ice cream afternoon. Great.
[MICHAEL] That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
[MICHAEL] No, it... Yes, okay, right.  All right, yep. My bad. I got it. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Come on. Okay, um...  That's as clear as I can make it.
[MICHAEL] Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us.
[MICHAEL] Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
[MICHAEL] Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
[MICHAEL] No. No, Toby. He's not. Yes he is. He's my nephew.
[MICHAEL] Luke is my nephew.
[MICHAEL] Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
[MICHAEL] Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] No! No. I'm just saying, why does God get to do something that I don't?
[MICHAEL] Well, then, why aren't you bugging me to fire everybody who's bad? You just want me to fire Luke. That's reverse nepotism. He should not be punished because he is related to me and bad at what he does!
[MICHAEL] Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is.
[MICHAEL] Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
[MICHAEL] Ok, you know what? Just -just back off! Back off!
[MICHAEL] All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
[MICHAEL] Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project.
[MICHAEL] I'm reconsidering sending them back anyway.
[MICHAEL] Wait a minute.
[MICHAEL] Don't-all right. Well, ok, you've just committed a felony.
[MICHAEL] No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.
[MICHAEL] Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
[MICHAEL] You don't have all the facts.
[MICHAEL] I love him.
[MICHAEL] No. No. He's my nephew.
[MICHAEL] Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
[MICHAEL] I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
[MICHAEL] Give me the pointer.
[MICHAEL] No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-
[MICHAEL] Okay, can I have that?
[MICHAEL] Ok, I am going to count down from five.
[MICHAEL] I'm not kidding.
[MICHAEL] Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
[MICHAEL] You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
[MICHAEL] That's what you're going to do, Luke!
[MICHAEL] I had to do that.
[MICHAEL] All right. Are we good?  You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment.
[MICHAEL] Yes, of course. What is this in reference to?
[MICHAEL] That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
[MICHAEL] I can do that.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Wait, what?
[MICHAEL] Is there another option?
[MICHAEL] This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
[MICHAEL] So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
[MICHAEL] One hour.
[MICHAEL] One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no! I know my rights! All I had to do was sit here for six hours. Do my time.
[MICHAEL] You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
[MICHAEL] Well, the other night, I was sitting at the table, eating my pen1s... I mean peas. That was weird. Aaaah... weird. I think that was ... I was probed. By an alien life form. An A.L.F. Alf, you know, I might have actually been probed by Alf. You might think he's a puppet. You never see the lower half. But there is a lower half.
[MICHAEL] Yes, Yes. They are all fake stories. What sort of twisted mind would come up with weird stories like that?  Three hours. We're half way done.
[MICHAEL] This is plenty complicated.
[MICHAEL] I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
[MICHAEL] Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
[MICHAEL] I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
[MICHAEL] I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
[MICHAEL] Right. Why would a dog do that? That's silly.
[MICHAEL] When I hear myself say it, it sounds ridiculous. But I've never said it out loud, so...
[MICHAEL] Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
[MICHAEL] You. Bitch. God! You're very helpful aren't you? You try to help everybody. Do you want to play another game?
[MICHAEL] You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] You'll do. . . ok. Filled out. Good. Thank you doctor. Take two of these  and call me in the morning.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake.
[MICHAEL] You don't make a mistake on purpose, Toby! Then it is no longer a mistake... Gabe. He messed it up. He messed up the forms, I bet...  "I mess everything up so I can fix it and keep my job! Bah! Good thing I'm here cause I do nothing. I make everybody nervous!"  Ah, ok. Got your notebook? Alright. Alright, lets bang this out. Let's do it to it!
[MICHAEL] Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
[MICHAEL] Andy, what time's the show?
[MICHAEL] How long is it?
[MICHAEL] Nope, can't make it.
[MICHAEL] I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
[MICHAEL] Wow.
[MICHAEL] I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play.
[MICHAEL] And scene.
[MICHAEL] I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Nope.
[MICHAEL] No, Darryl. This guy's a world-class actor. He doesn't daylight as your plumber.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me?
[MICHAEL] All right, I'm sorry. God.
[MICHAEL] Hello.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Good.
[MICHAEL] You enjoy the second act.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. You, too.
[MICHAEL] How is that funny?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, good job. Well done.
[MICHAEL] Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.
[MICHAEL] Get your eyes checked, chucklehead.
[MICHAEL] Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling.
[MICHAEL] That would never happen.
[MICHAEL] Okay. I appreciate the feedback.
[MICHAEL] Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I get those every day after work.
[MICHAEL] Oscar. Enough with the sass, please. God! What is wrong with you? Andy, listen to me. Look me in the eye. I thought that you were awesome.
[MICHAEL] I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
[MICHAEL] I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
[MICHAEL] Come on, Andy, seriously.
[MICHAEL] No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
[MICHAEL] Look,  It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
[MICHAEL] You mean cancer?
[MICHAEL] It is?
[MICHAEL] Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.
[MICHAEL] How?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
[MICHAEL] No! It was like four years ago!
[MICHAEL] Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six.
[MICHAEL] You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
[MICHAEL] Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God! What if I did?
[MICHAEL] Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
[MICHAEL] There's no way I'm gonna do that.
[MICHAEL] Hi Donna. It's Michael.
[MICHAEL] I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
[MICHAEL] I can't even say it. H-I...
[MICHAEL] ...R-P-E-E-S
[MICHAEL] No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
[MICHAEL] Does your stupid husband have it?
[MICHAEL] Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
[MICHAEL] No this is Holly.
[MICHAEL] No this is Holly.
[MICHAEL] Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
[MICHAEL] Oh really? Was anyone killed?
[MICHAEL] Any nuns?
[MICHAEL] Were they in the missionary position?
[MICHAEL] We would have twins.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm!
[MICHAEL] Mhhmm! We would be married.
[MICHAEL] Do what?
[MICHAEL] I don't romanticize th-  No...
[MICHAEL] He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
[MICHAEL] We were more than we were.
[MICHAEL] Ok, alright I gotta go.
[MICHAEL] It didn't come up organically.
[MICHAEL] Bringing home the bacon.
[MICHAEL] Would you excuse us...
[MICHAEL] He hasn't changed.
[MICHAEL] Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
[MICHAEL] Because we work together.
[MICHAEL] Am I the princess?
[MICHAEL] Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
[MICHAEL] I have herpes.
[MICHAEL] You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
[MICHAEL] No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I don't...
[MICHAEL] I know, I know.
[MICHAEL] Got it.
[MICHAEL] I'M TRYING! GOD!
[MICHAEL] I'm Michael. We dated for a while.
[MICHAEL] Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
[MICHAEL] Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
[MICHAEL] Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
[MICHAEL] Jerk.
[MICHAEL] Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
[MICHAEL] Carroll, how are you?
[MICHAEL] I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Weird...
[MICHAEL] He sounds like a nice guy.
[MICHAEL] You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
[MICHAEL] Someone told me that I romanticize relationships
[MICHAEL] I have herpes.
[MICHAEL] I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm, I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] I'm between specialists right now.
[MICHAEL] Well I believe in love at first sight.
[MICHAEL] I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
[MICHAEL] Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know? It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok. Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
[MICHAEL] Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
[MICHAEL] You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
[MICHAEL] Herpes duplex.
[MICHAEL] I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
[MICHAEL] Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
[MICHAEL] Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
[MICHAEL] An electric car dealership.
[MICHAEL] Oscar! Think abou- Think!
[MICHAEL] Nice!
[MICHAEL] She is a beaut!
[MICHAEL] Oh, look at that.  Smooth roll.
[MICHAEL] Oh, god!
[MICHAEL] I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.  Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
[MICHAEL] Oh, my god!
[MICHAEL] Ow!  You never forget. Whoo!
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?
[MICHAEL] It's Jim, Okay? Yes.
[MICHAEL] You need the big guns, yes?
[MICHAEL] I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight.  Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
[MICHAEL] No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?
[MICHAEL] No! Okay.  All right.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, that's a male model.
[MICHAEL] That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
[MICHAEL] Nice to meet you.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
[MICHAEL] Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
[MICHAEL] It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
[MICHAEL] You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.
[MICHAEL] And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.
[MICHAEL] Shake it, shake it!
[MICHAEL] Okay. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Thanks, Steve.
[MICHAEL] Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested.  Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?
[MICHAEL] Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?
[MICHAEL] Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
[MICHAEL] I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic.  See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
[MICHAEL] Oh, my god!
[MICHAEL] You know what this is? This is a stinger.
[MICHAEL] Like the movie.
[MICHAEL] Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.
[MICHAEL] Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, no. No. Don't-
[MICHAEL] Testify.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, he is that good-looking.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
[MICHAEL] Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
[MICHAEL] Stay-
[MICHAEL] Oh!
[MICHAEL] Don't let us down.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no....
[MICHAEL] I'm goin 'in!
[MICHAEL] Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
[MICHAEL] I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
[MICHAEL] Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
[MICHAEL] I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
[MICHAEL] A surveillance room next to this one.
[MICHAEL] Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
[MICHAEL] Well-
[MICHAEL] Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
[MICHAEL] No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
[MICHAEL] You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
[MICHAEL] So, you will?
[MICHAEL] Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
[MICHAEL] Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
[MICHAEL] I know, I know.
[MICHAEL] Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
[MICHAEL] I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
[MICHAEL] O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
[MICHAEL] No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
[MICHAEL] No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] No, you may not.
[MICHAEL] I said no.
[MICHAEL] We're not-
[MICHAEL] Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave.  Don't leave. Don't let him.
[MICHAEL] Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
[MICHAEL] No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.
[MICHAEL] He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
[MICHAEL] Good-bye!
[MICHAEL] MACGRUBER!
[MICHAEL] Oh, here we go!
[MICHAEL] OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
[MICHAEL] So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
[MICHAEL] Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I'm sorry. I blew this. You should have gotten credit for that, man.
[MICHAEL] Really? We're good?
[MICHAEL] Okay.  Okay.
[MICHAEL] Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
[MICHAEL] Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
[MICHAEL] You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
[MICHAEL] This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
[MICHAEL] I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
[MICHAEL] And we are going to straighten this out.
[MICHAEL] Mmhm!
[MICHAEL] No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
[MICHAEL] What is taking someone from behind?
[MICHAEL] It was a good idea, though.
[MICHAEL] What the hell are they talking about?
[MICHAEL] Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
[MICHAEL] Oh, you're sorry?
[MICHAEL] What did you just thought?
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Well, don't let it happen again.
[MICHAEL] I-
[MICHAEL] You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
[MICHAEL] Okay, that might help. If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody.
[MICHAEL] In front of me.
[MICHAEL] So that's it.
[MICHAEL] Is it?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I gotta get in on this.  Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
[MICHAEL] What's a bad idea?
[MICHAEL] NEVER!  Okay, you know what? Fine. I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
[MICHAEL] Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
[MICHAEL] Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
[MICHAEL] Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] If they're good ideas, I'm not gonna say no!
[MICHAEL] That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
[MICHAEL] Oh...
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
[MICHAEL] You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
[MICHAEL] I am not budging on the hat issue.
[MICHAEL] Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
[MICHAEL] Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
[MICHAEL] Sorry I was a jerk.
[MICHAEL] That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
[MICHAEL] Um... kay. Uh, alright.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yes.  Doobie-doobie doo.
[MICHAEL] But I'm the Godfather.
[MICHAEL] Are you talking to me?
[MICHAEL] Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I'm not the godfather.
[MICHAEL] So who is the godfather?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?
[MICHAEL] No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
[MICHAEL] Good morning.
[MICHAEL] Good morning.
[MICHAEL] Good morning.
[MICHAEL] No, I insist. After me.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. You too.
[MICHAEL] You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch.
[MICHAEL] Shh.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me? Stop it.
[MICHAEL] Shh.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
[MICHAEL] Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
[MICHAEL] Well, it's, it's-
[MICHAEL] No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.
[MICHAEL] I'll take a shirt.
[MICHAEL] If you'll have me, yes.
[MICHAEL] Really?  Thank you. All right.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going.
[MICHAEL] It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
[MICHAEL] You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
[MICHAEL] Hey, right?
[MICHAEL] Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
[MICHAEL] Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
[MICHAEL] No, you may not.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Mm. That's not gonna happen.
[MICHAEL] Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So...
[MICHAEL] How long till we get to Mexico?
[MICHAEL] Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
[MICHAEL] Why aren't they building it themselves?
[MICHAEL] Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
[MICHAEL] Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
[MICHAEL] Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
[MICHAEL] And Cinco de Mayo.
[MICHAEL] No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
[MICHAEL] Do that. Do it.
[MICHAEL] Okay, driver, driver, if you're not gonna stop this bus, then I'm going to stop it for you. Okay? Hang on.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
[MICHAEL] Stop the bus, okay?
[MICHAEL] I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.
[MICHAEL] Blah-di-blah!
[MICHAEL] We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
[MICHAEL] Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
[MICHAEL] Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you.
[MICHAEL] Why quick?
[MICHAEL] Is anyone still at the church?
[MICHAEL] What? Shut up.
[MICHAEL] It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
[MICHAEL] They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
[MICHAEL] Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street!  Come on everybody!
[MICHAEL] Walk with me.
[MICHAEL] Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
[MICHAEL] Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
[MICHAEL] Cancel it! Are you still here?
[MICHAEL] MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
[MICHAEL] I'm joking.
[MICHAEL] I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry.  I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
[MICHAEL] You know who my favorite character is? The invalid.  I am coming to your party.
[MICHAEL] Yes, I am. Are you?
[MICHAEL] What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
[MICHAEL] Why did you just say he was the boss?
[MICHAEL] Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
[MICHAEL] Uh huh...
[MICHAEL] Big...
[MICHAEL] All right!
[MICHAEL] Okay okay okay.
[MICHAEL] Try and destroy the old ways, Gabe, well I will not let you.
[MICHAEL] Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!
[MICHAEL] Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah!  There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
[MICHAEL] Well some of us are trying to have a...
[MICHAEL] Well I will turn up the volume.
[MICHAEL] Okay... Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
[MICHAEL] Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
[MICHAEL] Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
[MICHAEL] So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
[MICHAEL] Well...
[MICHAEL] He's the longest baby in this room.
[MICHAEL] You know what Erin you do have to.
[MICHAEL] That's what she said.
[MICHAEL] I just went out for a walk.
[MICHAEL] What? Really? That stinks!
[MICHAEL] What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding me?
[MICHAEL] Now that's going on?
[MICHAEL] Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot.
[MICHAEL] No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
[MICHAEL] What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
[MICHAEL] Go to your room.
[MICHAEL] Go to your room young lady!
[MICHAEL] As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
[MICHAEL] Oh do not raise your voice to me!
[MICHAEL] Gahh, I will pull this car over!
[MICHAEL] If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
[MICHAEL] My Bad. Space Heater and Fan were both on high, plugged into the same outlet.
[MICHAEL] Uh... try "password".
[MICHAEL] Uh... it was like eight years ago?
[MICHAEL] Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been... Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
[MICHAEL] You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
[MICHAEL] The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
[MICHAEL] I'm Facebook.
[MICHAEL] I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back.
[MICHAEL] A what?
[MICHAEL] Dot com!
[MICHAEL] I was looking at a trail map, and I was thinking that we should start on a bunny hill, because I've never actually been skiing. And then work our way up to death drop.
[MICHAEL] Your kidding?!
[MICHAEL] You and me.
[MICHAEL] Don't you work here full-time?
[MICHAEL] Mm-Hmm.
[MICHAEL] That does sound fun to me.
[MICHAEL] MONEY!
[MICHAEL] Pervert.
[MICHAEL] That's good to know.
[MICHAEL] Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
[MICHAEL] Whoo!
[MICHAEL] We already have a buyer.
[MICHAEL] At least.
[MICHAEL] That's right!
[MICHAEL] Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
[MICHAEL] No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
[MICHAEL] Look at that. Triple your investment by January.
[MICHAEL] There you go.
[MICHAEL] Do not talk like that, Stanley.
[MICHAEL] Here we go.
[MICHAEL] "It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!"
[MICHAEL] "He's up there."
[MICHAEL] Look at that! He threw 'em on the ground!
[MICHAEL] No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that.
[MICHAEL] I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
[MICHAEL] I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
[MICHAEL] Can't talk, saving the planet.
[MICHAEL] We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
[MICHAEL] Eight Years.
[MICHAEL] No, I won't even consider it.
[MICHAEL] Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
[MICHAEL] I think you are wrong.
[MICHAEL] You may be right. I may be crazy.
[MICHAEL] I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
[MICHAEL] I thought it might make me feel better.
[MICHAEL] But it just may be a lunatic...  No.
[MICHAEL] Good, good, bro.
[MICHAEL] Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
[MICHAEL] Nine days, though. That's, like...
[MICHAEL] Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
[MICHAEL] Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
[MICHAEL] So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
[MICHAEL] Mm-Hmm.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so...
[MICHAEL] Tonight?
[MICHAEL] Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
[MICHAEL] Hello.
[MICHAEL] I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
[MICHAEL] I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.  And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground.
[MICHAEL] Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.
[MICHAEL] You can't have it.
[MICHAEL] Thank God.
[MICHAEL] It was great. China.
[MICHAEL] Everything here was made in China, Pam.
[MICHAEL] They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, right here. It is right there.  Anybody read the news any more?
[MICHAEL] I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] So much for keeping our secrets up high.
[MICHAEL] I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
[MICHAEL] Welcome to your future.
[MICHAEL] How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
[MICHAEL] Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.
[MICHAEL] Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
[MICHAEL] I don't know.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
[MICHAEL] No, no. That is right now.
[MICHAEL] In terms of land, not population.
[MICHAEL] No, no you're wrong about this.
[MICHAEL] I got it from NewYorkTimes.com
[MICHAEL] Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
[MICHAEL] Very comedically humorous Jim.
[MICHAEL] Try 'Control P'.
[MICHAEL] Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Mmm.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Sure.
[MICHAEL] Coffee Jim.
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
[MICHAEL] I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California."  What?
[MICHAEL] Pass.
[MICHAEL] Pass.
[MICHAEL] Lifeline.
[MICHAEL] I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
[MICHAEL] Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
[MICHAEL] Is it going to be worth it?
[MICHAEL] I don't need to cheat.
[MICHAEL] Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
[MICHAEL] Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
[MICHAEL] How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
[MICHAEL] Don't... I...
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I figured that.
[MICHAEL] Wait. You forgetting something?
[MICHAEL] This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
[MICHAEL] Here we are.
[MICHAEL] My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
[MICHAEL] I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
[MICHAEL] Raise your cups on high. Case closed.
[MICHAEL] People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one.
[MICHAEL] That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?
[MICHAEL] I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] We didn't get it.
[MICHAEL] How's everybody doing today?
[MICHAEL] How's the party coming along?
[MICHAEL] Are we over budget?
[MICHAEL] No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
[MICHAEL] Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?
[MICHAEL] So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
[MICHAEL] Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
[MICHAEL] Whatcha got?
[MICHAEL] Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
[MICHAEL] Yeah!
[MICHAEL] Pam? Pam?
[MICHAEL] Hi.
[MICHAEL] Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
[MICHAEL] Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
[MICHAEL] You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
[MICHAEL] That was the worst joke ever.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
[MICHAEL] What? What?
[MICHAEL] Hold on, Holly's coming back here?
[MICHAEL] That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
[MICHAEL] Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
[MICHAEL] You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
[MICHAEL] Cancel. We're canceling it.
[MICHAEL] No, we have to cancel the party.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
[MICHAEL] Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.
[MICHAEL] You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
[MICHAEL] Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Sure.
[MICHAEL] You never know about the press.
[MICHAEL] Could he help us with some parking tickets?
[MICHAEL] Well, then he's not a senator.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] Yes, that's me. Come on it.
[MICHAEL] She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.
[MICHAEL] What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.
[MICHAEL] And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
[MICHAEL] There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?
[MICHAEL] Hello.
[MICHAEL] Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old b*st*rd.
[MICHAEL] Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?
[MICHAEL] Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
[MICHAEL] D'oh!
[MICHAEL] Hi. Hi. Oh...
[MICHAEL] Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!  Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
[MICHAEL] That's adorable.
[MICHAEL] Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
[MICHAEL] Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk.  I show you to your desk.
[MICHAEL] What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
[MICHAEL] Oh...
[MICHAEL] Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah!  Oh, I love toy...
[MICHAEL] Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
[MICHAEL] You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.
[MICHAEL] Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
[MICHAEL] You're kidding me. Ahh!
[MICHAEL] What a douche bag!
[MICHAEL] Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm.
[MICHAEL] Good for him.
[MICHAEL] Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
[MICHAEL] Oh, you do?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
[MICHAEL] Me too.
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.
[MICHAEL] It's a sophisticated take.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
[MICHAEL] Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
[MICHAEL] What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
[MICHAEL] All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk?  Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
[MICHAEL] I haven't told you about her.
[MICHAEL] I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."
[MICHAEL] I do. She is.
[MICHAEL] What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.
[MICHAEL] Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.
[MICHAEL] It is Christmas.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
[MICHAEL] Ahhhhhh!  Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
[MICHAEL] I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
[MICHAEL] All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
[MICHAEL] Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.
[MICHAEL] When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
[MICHAEL] And we did this whole stupid party for you.
[MICHAEL] Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
[MICHAEL] Hey
[MICHAEL] Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
[MICHAEL] Good trip down?
[MICHAEL] Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
[MICHAEL] Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
[MICHAEL] Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, well, at least he was married.
[MICHAEL] No, it's not. It's not. Oh, man, I can tell you confidently that it is not gonna be okay.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.
[MICHAEL] No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
[MICHAEL] From the mall. That...
[MICHAEL] Well, that...
[MICHAEL] Hey.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?
[MICHAEL] I think I know where he is.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm.
[MICHAEL] Video games.
[MICHAEL] A DSi?
[MICHAEL] A horse.
[MICHAEL] You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?
[MICHAEL] All right. You have to pick up after them.
[MICHAEL] Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot.
[MICHAEL] Happy.
[MICHAEL] Sad. To soak up my tears.
[MICHAEL] Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
[MICHAEL] Sad, something to break.
[MICHAEL] For you, job well done.
[MICHAEL] Both sad.
[MICHAEL] I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael.
[MICHAEL] Shaaa-shut up. Hello.
[MICHAEL] So... high five me. We're back. To a happy...  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
[MICHAEL] They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
[MICHAEL] Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God! That's it! That's it!
[MICHAEL] I'm trying!
[MICHAEL] I'm trying!
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] I'm not listening to music!
[MICHAEL] Go! Oh, that's nice.
[MICHAEL] Me? Okay.
[MICHAEL] I'm good.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God!
[MICHAEL] That is neat.
[MICHAEL] E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] Bummer.
[MICHAEL] Reese's Pieces.
[MICHAEL] I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible.
[MICHAEL] When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
[MICHAEL] But you did still love him.
[MICHAEL] Do you love him now?
[MICHAEL] No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend.  Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
[MICHAEL] You think she'd talk to you?
[MICHAEL] That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
[MICHAEL] Or sooner.
[MICHAEL] That's not a joke.
[MICHAEL] Is it?
[MICHAEL] Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
[MICHAEL] What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
[MICHAEL] You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone? Loser.
[MICHAEL] Just do a cartwheel!
[MICHAEL] Eat it.
[MICHAEL] No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
[MICHAEL] Eat it. Put it in your mouth, and just eat it.
[MICHAEL] I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it!
[MICHAEL] Eat it!
[MICHAEL] All right, all right, shh!
[MICHAEL] Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue.  Oh, God! You guys are pathetic.
[MICHAEL] No! You can't have any candy!
[MICHAEL] Not Michael, E.T.
[MICHAEL] Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there.
[MICHAEL] And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax.
[MICHAEL] It was insensitive and I am sorry.
[MICHAEL] I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line.
[MICHAEL] You're right. And I hope that we can still be friends.
[MICHAEL] Okay, oh! All right.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] Yup.
[MICHAEL] You can toss them.
[MICHAEL] You ready to do this?
[MICHAEL] You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
[MICHAEL] It's about you. It's about you. Go!
[MICHAEL] You did?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
[MICHAEL] Oh, sorry, mate. Excuse me. Mate.
[MICHAEL] English?
[MICHAEL] Oh no no, I'm not picking on you at all. You're English, correct?
[MICHAEL] I'm working on an English character. Would you mind gi... It's called Reginald Pooftah.
[MICHAEL] Michael Scott.
[MICHAEL] I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping!
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. And people don't understand that is has nothing to do with making fun of a different nationality.
[MICHAEL] That's good. Pleasure to meet you.
[MICHAEL] Dunder Mifflin.
[MICHAEL] No, not right now.
[MICHAEL] All right. See you around.
[MICHAEL] Bye-bye. What a nice guy.
[MICHAEL] Hello, I am here for the small business seminar.
[MICHAEL] Nein! I'm greek! My name is Mikanos.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Ugh. You're the fifth person to tell me that today.
[MICHAEL] Okay, yeah, like a character history. Good. Tom Hanks does that.
[MICHAEL] Practice Olympics.
[MICHAEL] I like the musical "Grease", or as we call it, "home".
[MICHAEL] She will have a greekaccino.
[MICHAEL] It...
[MICHAEL] I can't believe-ee. It's a miracle. She can talk!
[MICHAEL] No more brain damage!
[MICHAEL] Dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. You know, I like you. I'm going to give you my secret gyro recipe. Come out here since it's a secret, and I'll tell you.   All, you have to close right now.
[MICHAEL] No, you're not. You're getting past it. You have to close. You can do it.
[MICHAEL] Andy, what's the problem?
[MICHAEL] You, Kelly and Creed, Kevin, they believe in you. Don't let them down. Don't let yourself down, Andy. I'm gonna go back in. I'm going to stall them for a little bit. I want you to get your head together, and then come back in. I want you to close.   What is taking that guy so long?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no.
[MICHAEL] Almost as good as the first day when we first met. You are the love of my life. Come to me, Necropolis. Put your lips on my lips. Come on.
[MICHAEL] What? Come on. It's time for grapes.  Real fun day.
[MICHAEL] Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
[MICHAEL] You broke up with AJ weeks ago.
[MICHAEL] I don't understand. I really don't. I mean, we know we are going to start dating. Why not now?
[MICHAEL] Sure we do.
[MICHAEL] Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I understand. I just don't agree.
[MICHAEL] Yes I do.
[MICHAEL] Yes I do.
[MICHAEL] I have my own opinion and my opinion is to disagree with you.
[MICHAEL] Let's go.
[MICHAEL] Let's go!
[MICHAEL] Just drive faster. I want to get back.
[MICHAEL] Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit.
[MICHAEL] No I'm not. I'm not in a bad mood. I'm not, Jim. Hello? Ok fine, ignore me. Have it your way. Let's just talk about you, as always. Is s*x different after the baby, Jim?
[MICHAEL] I need to pee.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, I do. My word against yours.
[MICHAEL] What part of "I need to pee" do you not understand? I'm upset. My bladder is full. There is no telling what I might do right now all over the inside of your precious little car.
[MICHAEL] Well I hope I make it.
[MICHAEL] There is no way he ditched me. There is no way that happened. He's my... Ok. May I please just use your phone? Please!
[MICHAEL] Ok. I will make it quick. I will make it very quick.  And you don't have my numbers on speed dial. Ah, Ok. What is it?
[MICHAEL] You know what, I can dial 411, get Jim's number.
[MICHAEL] Well I understand that but this is a $45 watch.
[MICHAEL] With that I can buy... half the menu.
[MICHAEL] All right. What do you do with the hog dogs that you don't sell?
[MICHAEL] Well, okay, instead of throwing them all away later, why don't you just throw one away now into my mouth?
[MICHAEL] Okay. You've just lost my business.
[MICHAEL] Okay. I'll be right back. . Okay. You know what? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have my wallet and I was gonna try to dine and dash and that was stupid and I realize I can't do that to you fine people.
[MICHAEL] Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
[MICHAEL] Well the number three is not such a giant feast.
[MICHAEL] I am not. I just have had a bad day. And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now.
[MICHAEL] Well, I think I can get through the door.
[MICHAEL] Hi.  How did you know I was up here?
[MICHAEL] I got turned around. I thought I could see Dunder Mifflin.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.  Wow. I just miss you so much.
[MICHAEL] Really?
[MICHAEL] Can I kiss you?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Miss you. Okay. I'll be in my office if you need me.
[MICHAEL] Okay, bye. Bye. All right, bye. Bye... bye.
[MICHAEL] Don't go. I don't want you to go. Oh don't go. Don't go.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Sit. Okay, just close your eyes.
[MICHAEL] Oh, yeah.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
[MICHAEL] Perfect. Yes. It is quite apro-propriate. Carry on.
[MICHAEL] What, are you talking about me and Holly?
[MICHAEL] Whispering and tickling have their place in business.
[MICHAEL] I... Okay, yeah, that's pretty hot. I will give you that. Look, you are all hypocrites. You all do it.
[MICHAEL] Thank you.
[MICHAEL] All right.
[MICHAEL] Okay. Fine. No more PDA.
[MICHAEL] You win. But here's what we are going to do. We are going to designate one of our closets as a hook-up zone.
[MICHAEL] Anything goes.
[MICHAEL] Okay, then we have two closets. No, no, we're gonna have three closets, one for each base, no homers. Yes?
[MICHAEL] Pro.
[MICHAEL] What? Problem solved.
[MICHAEL] Ah, the old "leave behind." Oldest trick in the book. Good thing it's working.
[MICHAEL] Since when is comfort the most important thing? I mean, I don't... I don't sit on your lap because it's comfortable. I sit on your lap because I like the way your thighs feel on my butt.
[MICHAEL] Oh. Okay. Well, if it makes you uncomfortable, then we'll stop.
[MICHAEL] I love you.
[MICHAEL] I love you-love you.
[MICHAEL] I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you.
[MICHAEL] Here, shake. No!
[MICHAEL] No, we can't.
[MICHAEL] No touching. Ah, I'm trying not to touch you.
[MICHAEL] Oh.
[MICHAEL] Oh, no, so close. Oh. No, we can't do that. We can't do this. Ohh.
[MICHAEL] I don't know what your body feels like 'cause I can't touch it.
[MICHAEL] Grab you here.
[MICHAEL] I will grab you here anyway.
[MICHAEL] Never.
[MICHAEL] I did say I would, but I was wrong. I can't stop. You don't what it is like to love a woman and have her love you back. It is a feeling that cannot and will not, and frankly, cannot be contained.
[MICHAEL] Yes, it was that. It's that one.
[MICHAEL] We're not supposed to PDA.
[MICHAEL] I haven't thought about you having to go back to Nashua.
[MICHAEL] That's what we said last time. Remember? We broke up on the drive. How's this gonna be any different?
[MICHAEL] I was in love with you.
[MICHAEL] It's like a time bomb...
[MICHAEL] ...is ticking down. When it goes off, no more kissing. No more hugging.
[MICHAEL] Sexual time bomb.
[MICHAEL] Boner Bomb starring Jason Statham. Or we go against type with an Eisenberg or a Michael Cera.
[MICHAEL] No.  Saving the world has never been this hard.
[MICHAEL] No, I can't talk to her. I can't even look at her without thinking about it ending.
[MICHAEL] Do the monkey face.
[MICHAEL] I love that. I love that face.
[MICHAEL] No. The monkey!
[MICHAEL] Don't do the squirrel. Throw your poop.
[MICHAEL] That's good.
[MICHAEL] That's good. He's throwing it.
[MICHAEL] I know.
[MICHAEL] Holly, I love you so, so, so much. And I think we need to break up.
[MICHAEL] Actually, it's Valentine's Day. Shouldn't be doing this today. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
[MICHAEL] You're gonna go back to Nashua eventually, and I can't handle it. So let's just...let's...
[MICHAEL] Who?
[MICHAEL] Okay. Okay.
[MICHAEL] Well, the point is, there will no longer be any need for PDA here at the office between us because, when we get home, we are going to make love to and with one another, and that, to me, is the best Valentine's Day present that a person could receive. So I bid you all adieu.
[MICHAEL] I do.
[MICHAEL] Clean up on aisle five. : Midnight titlescreen appears]
[MICHAEL] That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
[MICHAEL] Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
[MICHAEL] Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.
[MICHAEL] It's got a lot of me.
[MICHAEL] Tell him I'm retired.
[MICHAEL] Goldenface, this makes it personal.
[MICHAEL] Heads I do it, tails I don't. Best out of seven.  Heads.  Tails. ...Heads...Tails...Heads...Tails.  Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five.
[MICHAEL] What am I supposed to do with this?
[MICHAEL] Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me.
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] Yeah?
[MICHAEL] I am sorry that I have to do this...
[MICHAEL] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
[MICHAEL] Jack Blaise.
[MICHAEL] The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
[MICHAEL] He said, where is the bomb?
[MICHAEL] Why are you telling me this?
[MICHAEL] Hey Goldenface.
[MICHAEL] Go puck yourself!
[MICHAEL] It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn.
[MICHAEL] For the insurance money! I knew it all along!  You will never get away with this!
[MICHAEL] I got problems Billy. Big problems...
[MICHAEL] Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.
[MICHAEL] No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died.
[MICHAEL] Well my name's Michael Scarn and I'm here to say, I'm about to do The Scarn in a major way.  You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!  You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!
[MICHAEL] Well that's a... pretty good reaction.  Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
[MICHAEL] Okay.  No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
[MICHAEL] Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
[MICHAEL] Did you? What did you love about it?
[MICHAEL] Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
[MICHAEL] It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.
[MICHAEL] I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
[MICHAEL] Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
[MICHAEL] I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.
[MICHAEL] This one's for you Cherokee Jack.
[MICHAEL] No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they , they were trying to qualify, they were disqualified, they had to forfeit the game. Undefeated season. That's why there were so many people there.
[MICHAEL] No it's not.  It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
[MICHAEL] Hello sir.
[MICHAEL] Ugh...  I'm in.
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah!  Yes he is!
[MICHAEL] No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid.
[MICHAEL] Still not seeing the problem here.
[MICHAEL] Hi.
[MICHAEL] Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
[MICHAEL] And it also helps if you've had five shots.
[MICHAEL] Whoa!
[MICHAEL] Is Packer here?
[MICHAEL] Don't know, don't care.
[MICHAEL] Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
[MICHAEL] You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
[MICHAEL] And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
[MICHAEL] So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here.
[MICHAEL] Let's look at this.
[MICHAEL] Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom!
[MICHAEL] No!
[MICHAEL] Best day ever. Best day ever!
[MICHAEL] Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
[MICHAEL] Please.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell.
[MICHAEL] No. Not me, him.
[MICHAEL] Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
[MICHAEL] He's funnier than me.
[MICHAEL] So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
[MICHAEL] Uhm...
[MICHAEL] That's insane!
[MICHAEL] And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.
[MICHAEL] I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
[MICHAEL] You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
[MICHAEL] No it isn't.
[MICHAEL] Yeah, a little bit.
[MICHAEL] I won't.
[MICHAEL] Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
[MICHAEL] Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
[MICHAEL] Kevin, do you accept the apology?
[MICHAEL] Okay, go back to the annex.
[MICHAEL] That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
[MICHAEL] I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
[MICHAEL] What are you doing?
[MICHAEL] I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
[MICHAEL] Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
[MICHAEL] You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
[MICHAEL] He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
[MICHAEL] Yes, about that.
[MICHAEL] Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
[MICHAEL] No, nothing like that at all.
[MICHAEL] Sorry?
[MICHAEL] Sounds great.
[MICHAEL] That is.  It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
[MICHAEL] Nah, he's an ass.
[MICHAEL] You ahh.
[MICHAEL] No you ahh.
[MICHAEL] You ahh.
[MICHAEL] I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
[MICHAEL] Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
[MICHAEL] 500
[MICHAEL] Get lost.
[MICHAEL] That is how you do it.
[MICHAEL] You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
[MICHAEL] In case... in case of what?
[MICHAEL] I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
[MICHAEL] Get lost.
[MICHAEL] Hi.
[MICHAEL] Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
[MICHAEL] Well, I'm writing a message.
[MICHAEL] I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
[MICHAEL] Maybe.
[MICHAEL] Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
[MICHAEL] Pam.
[MICHAEL] I am not in the mood for riddles pam.
[MICHAEL] No, this is romantic.
[MICHAEL] Why?
[MICHAEL] I did?
[MICHAEL] Yes.
[MICHAEL] I could not have agreed with you more.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
[MICHAEL] I had a great idea until you ruined it.
[MICHAEL] How about this I throw a corpse dressed like me off of the roof, it hits the ground, the head pops off, this leads me to the line ' I lost my head when I fell in love with you.'
[MICHAEL] It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
[MICHAEL] Heres the ring.
[MICHAEL] Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
[MICHAEL] Is she not going to like that?
[MICHAEL] At a gas station?
[MICHAEL] That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
[MICHAEL] Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
[MICHAEL] I just... it's terrifying.
[MICHAEL] I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
[MICHAEL] Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
[MICHAEL] Oh ok. For how long?
[MICHAEL] Is he alright?
[MICHAEL] You ok?
[MICHAEL] Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
[MICHAEL] Ok.
[MICHAEL] No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
[MICHAEL] That's great and we still have most of our stuff. Good.
[MICHAEL] No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
[MICHAEL] Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
[MICHAEL] This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
[MICHAEL] And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
[MICHAEL] In-grown hair.
[MICHAEL] We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
[MICHAEL] And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
[MICHAEL] Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do.
[MICHAEL] Let's go in here.
[MICHAEL] This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
[MICHAEL] That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
[MICHAEL] That marriage would be a sham.
[MICHAEL] Easy no.
[MICHAEL] That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
[MICHAEL] Only one that I was kind of worried about.
[MICHAEL] Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
[MICHAEL] Yep.
[MICHAEL] Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
[MICHAEL] Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
[MICHAEL] Oh, really?
[MICHAEL] And to middles, the unsung heroes. And to moms.
[MICHAEL] Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday.
[MICHAEL] I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
[MICHAEL] Yep. Don't mess with Colorado.
[MICHAEL] No, no. I don't want to end up like Sunny Bobo.
[MICHAEL] You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
[MICHAEL] That's what I've heard.
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?
[MICHAEL] Really? What happened?
[MICHAEL] Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
[MICHAEL] Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry.
[MICHAEL] No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar.
[MICHAEL] You are? What bar?
[MICHAEL] I... do not see you.
[MICHAEL] I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
[MICHAEL] What're you wearing?
[MICHAEL] Are we both at the right place?
[MICHAEL] I hear your voice.
[MICHAEL] I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man!  Michael Scott.
[MICHAEL] Wow... that is insane!
[MICHAEL] Alright! Here we go!
[MICHAEL] I am well, sir, how are you?
[MICHAEL] I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
[MICHAEL] Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
[MICHAEL] Yes it was.
[MICHAEL] Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
[MICHAEL] You know me very well, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] Now I'm gonna have to go online and look at turtles or I'll be off all day.
[MICHAEL] So you decided to have an orgy and not invite me? I call the middle!
[MICHAEL] I sorta like the old way.
[MICHAEL] I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
[MICHAEL] Is that good?
[MICHAEL] Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
[MICHAEL] You can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
[MICHAEL] Shave me.  This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
[MICHAEL] And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.
[MICHAEL] It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
[MICHAEL] Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
[MICHAEL] That's-
[MICHAEL] You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
[MICHAEL] Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
[MICHAEL] Don't shave my lips.
[MICHAEL] You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
[MICHAEL] Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
[MICHAEL] PB and J, my mom's recipe!
[MICHAEL] I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] Oscar, here you go.
[MICHAEL] No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
[MICHAEL] No, that's good. You just stay in there, stay in there by yourself, loser. No body go in.  No body go in there. Stay where you are.
[MICHAEL] No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No.
[MICHAEL] Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
[MICHAEL] I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
[MICHAEL] Ok.  Why did you have to be so damn good?
[MICHAEL] No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
[MICHAEL] You'll figure it out.
[MICHAEL] Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
[MICHAEL] Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
[MICHAEL] Surprise!
[MICHAEL] You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
[MICHAEL] Here we go! Have Pam come down.
[MICHAEL] We got it.
[MICHAEL] Yeah that's fine.
[MICHAEL] Go go go go go go!
[MICHAEL] Here we go, alright got it? Set?  Hello?
[MICHAEL] Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
[MICHAEL] Go.
[MICHAEL] You have big plans for tonight?
[MICHAEL] You are getting so funny!  Very good.
[MICHAEL] Black tie optional.
[MICHAEL] A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
[MICHAEL] Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
[MICHAEL] So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host.  And that person is  DeAngelo!
[MICHAEL] Think of it as part of your training.
[MICHAEL] Okay, well we'll work on it.
[MICHAEL] You are doing it.
[MICHAEL] Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
[MICHAEL] Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
[MICHAEL] Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay.  Ryan how are you today?
[MICHAEL] There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration. Just be funny.
[MICHAEL] No! God!
[MICHAEL] No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
[MICHAEL] Jim, please no loopholes.
[MICHAEL] This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
[MICHAEL] Good. Good. Good!
[MICHAEL] Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
[MICHAEL] Too personal. I don't wanna hear about it.  Let's try this. Put these on.  I am going to turn this on, and turn the volume all the way up. So you can't-  That's right, you're not going to be able to hear yourself. Read this,  and make it sound perfect.
[MICHAEL] Say it with an accent!
[MICHAEL] The Dundies!
[MICHAEL] I'm here.  In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
[MICHAEL] No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
[MICHAEL] Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
[MICHAEL] You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, wondering: Does it get better? What I want you to do, is I want you to say: It's showtime. Get out there.
[MICHAEL] Say it.
[MICHAEL] You can do it, just say it.
[MICHAEL] Now hit me.  One, two, three.
[MICHAEL] Alright, here we go.
[MICHAEL] There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!
[MICHAEL] Well done.
[MICHAEL] Alright.
[MICHAEL] Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie.  I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
[MICHAEL] Year after year, I catch a lot of flak on this particular award, because year after year I present this award to a guy instead of a girl. Hottest in the office goes to,  Danny Cordray!  Danny couldn't be here tonight...
[MICHAEL] You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults?  Pippy Longstocking, Ronald McDonald's wife, Ron Howard, Ron Weasley, what do thay all have in common? Red heads. Erin Hannon, come on up here and receive your Cutest Red Head in the Office Award!
[MICHAEL] There you go.
[MICHAEL] It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers.
[MICHAEL] DeAngelo is expressing himself.
[MICHAEL] Okay, we're done! That's it.
[MICHAEL] We're done. We're done!
[MICHAEL] What?
[MICHAEL] No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
[MICHAEL] So what you're saying is you kinda like it?  I've fallen and I can't get up!  That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
[MICHAEL] That got a big laugh.
[MICHAEL] You were laughing right?
[MICHAEL] We're really close.
[MICHAEL] That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
[MICHAEL] You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.
[MICHAEL] Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
[MICHAEL] What is your problem?!
[MICHAEL] Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
[MICHAEL] He is in an all-out sprint.
[MICHAEL] Oh, okay.
[MICHAEL] Oh my God, something's happening.
[MICHAEL] No it's not.
[MICHAEL] Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it!
[MICHAEL] Yes?
[MICHAEL] Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
[MICHAEL] Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
[MICHAEL] Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
[MICHAEL] I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay?  The job was not mine to give.  Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
[MICHAEL] Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
[MICHAEL] ...in order to feed the bears.
[MICHAEL] How do you mean?
[MICHAEL] Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Hm?
[MICHAEL] Well I have interviews.
[MICHAEL] Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
[MICHAEL] Oh you don't, that's-
[MICHAEL] That sounds good. Thank you.
[MICHAEL] There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
[MICHAEL] Mmm!
[MICHAEL] You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
[MICHAEL] Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
[MICHAEL] What do you like Pam?
[MICHAEL] What kind of toppings would you like?
[MICHAEL] Sounds good. Fudge it up!
[MICHAEL] When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.  And she still is.
[MICHAEL] Ahh.
[MICHAEL] Sounds great, I just think it's great. Oh, I have gifts as well!  And I will start, by giving the first gift to Phyllis! Phyllis, you are shy and sweet, and you don't often speak your mind, but you should. Because you have great ideas. So Phyllis, I am giving you this, so you can always remember to speak your mind.
[MICHAEL] Stanley, you love your Sudoku and your puzzles, I bestow upon you, my felt.  May you never lose the fun loving quality in life.
[MICHAEL] Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts.
[MICHAEL] But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
[MICHAEL] You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
[MICHAEL] You're not gonna lose them.
[MICHAEL] Just do your best! I have faith in you.
[MICHAEL] You know who that is?
[MICHAEL] Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
[MICHAEL] Good, stand up.  You will be thin. You Won't drool over pizza like an animal anymore.
[MICHAEL] You will find love.
[MICHAEL] Don't be. You should never settle for who you are.  Oscar, Oscar, Oscar! Oscar, you are-
[MICHAEL] Okay, you know what? Just do your best buddy! Okay, Oscar, you are very smart, and you have a gigantic education. And, I think of you as my scarecrow, because you gave me a brain. So that's why I made you this.
[MICHAEL] How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.
[MICHAEL] Mmhmm, bravo!
[MICHAEL] Sure!
[MICHAEL] Who's that? Who's that guy?
[MICHAEL] I guess this could be the one, huh?
[MICHAEL] My last pay check?
[MICHAEL] No.
[MICHAEL] I'm not sure, um, Mountainton?
[MICHAEL] Nah, I'm almost done.
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] Hi. What is the name of our town?
[MICHAEL] No, no. I just needed to hear your voice.
[MICHAEL] Yes.  Yes my hero!
[MICHAEL] Ohh, I miss you.
[MICHAEL] Okay. I'll see you tonight. I love you.
[MICHAEL] Yes, so I know I told everybody that tomorrow is my last day, but I'm, I'm gonna be leaving tonight. I head to the airport at four.  And I have said goodbye to half of them.
[MICHAEL] Okay.
[MICHAEL] Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
[MICHAEL] If I just went away right now, would that be the best gift that I could give you?
[MICHAEL] Yeah.
[MICHAEL] You're not prone to seizures?
[MICHAEL] Okay...
[MICHAEL] I would like to give you, the only copy, of Somehow I Manage.  Unfinished. If there's anyone here who can finish it, it's you.
